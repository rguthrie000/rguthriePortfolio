Promises, schedules, and estimates are necessary and important
instruments in a well-ordered business.

Many engineers fail to realize this, or habitually try to dodge the irksome
responsibility for making commitments.  You *must* make promises based upon
your own estimates for the part of the job for which you are responsible,
together with estimates obtained from contributing departments for their
parts.  No one should be allowed to avoid the issue by the old formula, "I
can't give a promise because it depends upon so many uncertain factors."
Consider the "uncertain factors" confronting a department head who must
make up a budget for an entire engineering department for a year in advance!
Even the most uncertain case can be narrowed down by first asking, "Will
it be done in a matter of a few hours or a few months -- a few days or a few
weeks?"  It usually turns out that it cannot be done in less than three
weeks and surely will not require more than five, in which case you'd better
say four weeks.  This allows one week for contingencies and sets you a
reasonable bogie under the comfortable figure of five weeks.  Both extremes
are bad; a good engineer will set schedules which he can meet by energetic
effort at a pace commensurate with the significance of the job.

The Tao that can be told

Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

Yet mystery and manifestations
arise from the same source.
This source is called darkness.

Darkness within darkness.

When people see some things as beautiful,
other things become ugly.
When people see some things as good,
other things become bad.

Being and non-being create each other.
Difficult and easy support each other.
Long and short define each other.
High and low depend on each other.
Before and after follow each other.

Therefore the Master
acts without doing anything
and teaches without saying anything.
Things arise and she lets them come;
things disappear and she lets them go.
She has but doesn't possess,
acts but doesn't expect.
When her work is done, she forgets it.
That is why it lasts forever.

He helps people lose everything
they know, everything they desire,
and creates confusion

Practice not-doing,

Can you let your body become

Can you deal with the most vital matters
by letting events take their course?

having without possessing,
acting with no expectations,
leading and not trying to control:

See the world as your self.

Courteous as a guest.  Fluid as melting ice.
Shapeable as a block of wood.
Receptive as a valley.
Clear as a glass of water.

till your mud settles and the water is clear?
Can you remain unmoving
till the right action arises by itself?

Not seeking, not expecting,

can't empower himself.
He who clings to his work
will create nothing that endures.

There was something formless and perfect
before the universe was born.
It is serene.  Empty.
Solitary.  Unchanging.
Infinite.  Eternally present.
It is the mother of the universe.
For lack of a better name,
I call it the Tao.

It flows through all things,
inside and outside, and returns
to the origin of all things.

The Tao is great.
The universe is great.             Man follows the earth.
Earth is great.                    Earth follows the universe.
Man is great.                      The universe follows the Tao.
These are the four great powers.   The Tao follows only itself.

The heavy is the root of the light.
The unmoved is the source of all movement.

Thus the Master travels all day
without leaving home.
However splendid the views,
she stays serenely in herself.

Why should the lord of the country
flit about like a fool?
If you let yourself be blown to and fro,
you lose touch with your root.
If you let restlessness move you,
you lose touch with who you are.

A good traveler has no fixed plans
and is not intent upon arriving.
A good artist lets his intuition
lead him wherever it wants.
A good scientist has freed himself of concepts
and keeps his mind open to what is.

Thus the Master is available to all people
and doesn't reject anyone.
He is ready to use all situations
and doesn't waste anything.
This is called embodying the light.

What is a bad man but a good man's job?

Know the male,
yet keep to the female:
receive the world in your arms.
If you receive the world,
the Tao will never leave you
and you will be like a little child.

Know the white,
yet keep to the black:
be a pattern for the world.
If you are a pattern for the world,
the Tao will be strong inside you
and there will be nothing you can't do.

Know the personal,
yet keep to the impersonal:                The world is formed from the
void,
accept the world as it is.                 like utensils from a block of
wood.
If you accept the world,                   The Master knows the utensils,
the Tao will be luminous inside you        yet keeps to the block:
and you will return to your primal self.   thus she can use all things.

There is a time for being ahead,
a time for being behind;
a time for being in motion,
a time for being at rest;
a time for being vigorous,
a time for being exhausted;

The Master sees things as they are,
without trying to control them.

Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men
doesn't try to force issues
or defeat armies by force of arms.
For every force there is a counterforce.
Violence, even well intentioned,
always rebounds upon oneself.

The Master does his job
and then stops.
He understands that the universe
is forever out of control,
and that trying to dominate events
goes against the current of the Tao.
Because he believes in himself,
he doesn't try to convince others.
Because he is content with himself,
he doesn't need others' approval.
Because he accepts himself,
the whole world accepts him.

Peace is his highest value.
If the peace has been shattered,

His enemies are not demons,

He doesn't wish them personal harm.

All things are born from it,

It pours itself into its work,

The Master doesn't try to be powerful; thus he is truly powerful.
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power; thus he never has enough.

The Master does nothing, yet he leaves nothing undone.
The ordinary man is always doing things, yet many more are left to be done.

The kind man does something, yet something remains undone.
The just man does something, and leaves many things to be done.
The moral man does something, and when no one responds
he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.

When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.
When goodness is lost, there is morality.
When morality is lost, there is ritual.
Ritual is the husk of true faith, the beginning of chaos.

Therefore the Master concerns himself
with the depths and not the surface,
with the fruit and not the flower.
He has no will of his own.  He dwells in reality, and lets all illusions go.

Keep matters in suspense.

Successes that are novel win admiration.  Being too obvious is neither
useful nor tasteful.  By not declaring yourself immediately you will keep
people guessing, especially if your position is important enough to
awaken expectations.  Mystery by its very arcaneness causes veneration.
Even when revealing yourself, avoid total frankness, and don't let
everyone look inside you.  Cautious silence is where prudence takes refuge.
Once declared, resolutions are never esteemed, and they lie open to
criticism.  If they turn out badly, you will be twice unfortunate.  If you

Make people depend on you.

A god is made not by adorning the statue but by adoring it.  He who is
truly shrewd would rather have people need him than thank him.  Vulgar
gratitude is worth less than polite hope, for hope remembers and
gratitude forgets.  You will get more from dependence than from courtesy.
He who has already drunk turns his back on the well, and the orange
already squeezed turns from gold into mud.  When there is no longer
dependence, good manners disappear, and so does esteem.  The most
important lesson experience teaches is to maintain dependence, and
entertain it without satisfying it.  This can hold even a king.  But
don't carry it too far, leading others astray by your silence or making
their ills incurable for your own good.

Being defeated is hateful, and besting one's boss is either foolish
or fatal.  Superiority is always odious, especially to superiors and
sovereigns.  The common sort of advantages can be cautiously hidden,
as beauty is hidden with a touch of artful neglect.  Most people do
not mind being surpassed in good fortune, character, or temperament,
but no one, especially not a sovereign, likes to be surpassed in
intelligence.  For this is the king of attributes, and any crime
against it is lese majesty.  Sovereigns want to be so in what is most
important.  Princes like to be helped, but not surpassed.  When you
counsel someone, you should appear to be reminding him of something
he had forgotten, not of the light he was unable to see.  It is the

Act on the intentions of others:  their ulterior and superior motives.

Man's life on earth is a militia against malicia, or malice.  Cunning
arms itself with strategies of intention.  It never does what it
indicates.  It takes aim deceptively, feints nonchalantly in the air,
and delivers its blow, acting upon unforeseen reality with attentive
dissimulation.  To win the attention and confidence of others, it hints
at its intention.  But immediately it turns against that intention and
conquers through surprise.  The penetrating intelligence heads off
cunning with close observation, ambushes it with caution, understands
the opposite of what cunning wanted it to understand, and immediately
identifies false intentions.  Intelligence allows the first intention
to pass by, and awaits the second one, and even the third.  Simulation
grows even greater seeing that its guide has been penetrated, and
tries to deceive by telling the truth.  Changing strategies, it beguiles
us with its apparent lack of guile.  It bases its cunning on the greatest
candor.  But observation comes forward, sees through all this, and
discovers the shadows that are cloaked in light.  It deciphers intention,
which is most hidden when most simple.  Thus does the cunning of Python
struggle against the candor of the penetrating rays of Apollo.

in life:  skillfully making servants of those whom nature made superior.
We have little to live and much to know, and you cannot live if you do
not know.  It takes uncommon skill to study and learn without effort:
to study much through many, and know more than all of them together.  Do
this and you will go to a gathering and speak for many.  You will speak

thanks to the sweat of others.  Choose a subject, and let those around
you serve up quintessential knowledge.  If you can't make knowledge your

Keep changing your style of doing things.

Vary your methods.  This will confuse people, especially your rivals, and
awaken their curiosity and attention.  If you always act on your first
intention, others will foresee it and thwart it.  It is easy to kill the
bird that flies in a straight line, but not one that changes its line of
flight.  Don't always act on your second intention either; do something
twice, and others will discover the ruse.  Malice is ready to pounce on
you; you need a good deal of subtlety to outwit it.  The consummate player
never moves the piece his opponent expects him to, and, less still, the
piece he wants him to move.

Application and capacity.

Eminence requires both.  When both are present, eminence outdoes itself.
The mediocre people who apply themselves go further than the superior
people who don't.  Work makes worth.  You purchase reputation with it.
Some people are unable to apply themselves to even the simplest tasks.
Application depends almost always on temperament.  It is all right to be
mediocre at an unimportant job:  you can excuse yourself by saying you
were cut out for nobler things.  But to be mediocre at the lowest of jobs,
rather than excellent at the highest, has no excuse at all.  Both art and

When you start something, don't raise other people's expectations.

What is highly praised seldom measures up to expectation.  Reality never
catches up to imagination.  It is easy to imagine something is perfect,
and difficult to achieve it.  Imagination marries desire, and conceives
much more than things really are.  No matter how excellent something is,
it never satisfies our preconceptions.  The imagination feels cheated,
and excellence leads more often to disappointment than to admiration.
Hope is a great falsifier.  Let good judgment bridle her, so that
enjoyment will surpass desire.  Honorable beginnings should serve to
awaken curiosity, not to heighten people's expectations.  We are much
better off when reality surpasses out expectations, and something turns
out better than we thought it would.  This rule does not hold true for
bad things:  when an evil has been exaggerated, its reality makes people
applaud.  What was feared as ruinous comes to seem tolerable.

One of life's great lessons lies in knowing how to refuse, and it is even
more important to refuse yourself, both to business and to others.  There
are certain inessential activities -- moths of precious time -- and it is
worse to busy yourself with the trivial than to do nothing.  To be prudent,
it isn't enough not to meddle in other people's business:  you must also
keep them from meddling in yours.  Don't belong so much to others that you
stop belonging to yourself.  You shouldn't abuse your friends, or ask them
for more that they give on their own initiative.  All excess is a vice,
especially in your dealings with others.  With this judicious moderation
you will stay in the good graces of others and keep their esteem; and
propriety, which is precious, will not be worn away.  Retain your freedom

Know your best quality,

your outstanding gift.  Cultivate it and nurture all the rest.  All people
could have achieved eminence in something if only they had known what they
excelled at.  Identify your king of attributes and apply it in double
strength.  Some excel at judgment and others at courage.  Most people
force their intelligence and achieve superiority in nothing.  Their own
passions blind and flatter them until -- too late! -- time gives them the

Weigh matters carefully,

and think hardest about those that matter most.  Fools are lost by not
thinking.  They never conceive even the half of things, and because they
do not perceive either their advantages or their harm they do not apply
any diligence.  Some ponder things backward, paying much attention to what
matters little, and little to what matters much.  Many people never lose
their heads because they have none to lose.  There are things we should
consider very carefully and keep well rooted in our minds.  The wise weigh
everything:  they delve into things that are especially deep or doubtful,
and sometimes reflect that there is more than what occurs to them.  They
make reflection reach further than apprehension.

Take the measure of your luck:

in order to act, and in order to commit yourself.  This matters more than
identifying your predominant humor and understanding your physical makeup.
It is foolish for a forty year old to ask Hippocrates for health, and even
more foolish to ask Seneca for wisdom.  It is a great art to govern Fortune,
either waiting her (for she sometimes takes her time) or taking advantage
of her (for she sometimes turns good), although you will never completely
understand her inconsistent behavior.  If she has favored you, proceed with
boldness, for she often loves the daring and, like a dazzling woman, the
young.  If you are unlucky, act not.  Withdraw and save yourself from
failing twice.  If you master her, you have taken a great step forward.

Know what insinuation is, and how to use it.

It is the subtlest point in your dealings with others.  It can be used to
test the wits and cunningly probe the heart.  Some insinuation is malicious,
careless, tinged with the herbs of envy, smeared with the poison of passion:
an invisible lightning bolt that can knock you from grace and esteem.  Some
people owe their downfall to a single wounding, insinuating word.  Those
who expelled them from power showed not the slightest fear before an entire
conspiracy of common murmuring and singular malevolence.  Other insinuations
-- favorable ones -- do the opposite, shoring up our reputation.  But we
should catch these darts as skillfully as they are hurled at us by evil
intention:  catch them carefully, await them prudently.  A good defense
requires knowledge.  When we expect a blow we can ward it off.

Quit while you're ahead.

All the best gamblers do.  A fine retreat matters as much as a stylish
attack.  As soon as they are enough -- even when they are many -- cash
in your deeds.  A long run of good fortune is always suspicious.  You're
safer when good luck alternates with bad, and, besides, that makes for
bittersweet enjoyment.  When luck comes racing in on us, it is more likely
to slip and smash everything to pieces.  Sometimes Lady Luck compensates
us, trading intensity for duration.  She grows tired when she has to carry
someone on her back for a long time.

take advantage of them.

All works of nature reach their point of full perfection.  Before, they
were gaining; from then on, waning.  As for works of art, only rarely can
they not be improved.  People with good taste know how to enjoy each thing
when it reaches perfection.  Not everyone can, and not everyone who can
knows how.  Even the fruits of the understanding attain this ripeness.

Grace in dealing with others.

It is a great thing to win universal admiration, but even greater to win
benevolence.  Part of it is having a lucky star, but diligence is more
important.  One begins with the former and carries through with the latter.
It isn't enough to be eminently gifted, though people often suppose it is
easy to win affection when one has a reputation.  Benevolence depends on
beneficence.  Do all sorts of good:  good words and better deeds.  Love if
you would be loved.  Courtesy is the way great people bewitch others.
Reach for deeds and then for the pen.  From the sword to the pen, for there
is also grace among writers, and it is eternal.

Never exaggerate.

It isn't wise to use superlatives.  They offend the truth and cast doubt
on your judgment.  By exaggerating, you squander your praise and reveal a
lack of knowledge and taste.  Praise awakens curiosity, which begets
desire, and later, when the goods seem overpriced, as often happens,
expectation feels cheated and avenges itself by running down the praised
and the praiser.  The prudent show restraint, and would rather fall short
than long.  True eminences are rare, so temper your esteem.  To overvalue
something is a form of lying.  It can ruin your reputation for good taste,
and -- even worse -- for wisdom.

People like this have a lordly character:  kings by merit, lions by natural

Feel with the few, speak with the many.

Rowing against the current makes it impossible to discover the truth and
is extremely dangerous.  Only Socrates could attempt it.  Dissent is taken
as insult, for it condemns the judgment of others.  Many take offense,
whether on account of the person criticized or the one who applauded him.
The truth belongs to the few.  Deceit is as common as it is vulgar.  You
can never tell the wise by what they say in public.  They speak not in
their own voices, but in that of common stupidity, though deep inside they
are cursing it.  The sensible person avoids both being contradicted and
contradicting others.  He may be quick to censure, but he is slow to do so
in public.  Feelings are free; they cannot and should not be violated.
They live in silent retirement and show themselves only to a few sensible
people.

Sympathy with the great.

One of the gifts of the hero is the ability to dwell with heroes.  This
ability, called sympathy, is a wonder of nature, both because it is so
mysterious and because it is so beneficial.  There are similar hearts and
temperaments, and the effects of sympathy resemble those which vulgar
ignorance attributes to magic potions.  Not only can this sympathy help
us win renown, it inclines others towards us and quickly wins their
goodwill.  It persuades without words, achieves without merit.  There is
active and passive sympathy, and both kinds work wonders among people in
high positions.  It takes great skill to know them, distinguish between
them, and take advantage of them.  No amount of effort can take the place
of this mysterious favor.

Use, but don't abuse, hidden intentions,

suspicion, especially hidden intentions, which are hateful.  Deceit is
common, so be on your guard.  But hide your caution from others, so as not
to lose their confidence.  When it becomes known, caution offends others
and provokes vengeance, awakening unimagined evils.  A reflective way of
doing things will give you a great advantage.  Nothing provides more food
for thought.  The greatest perfection of an action depends on the mastery

We hate some people instinctively, even before we are aware of their good
qualities.  And sometimes this vulgar, natural aversion is directed towards
the eminent.  Let prudence keep it in check:  there is nothing more
demeaning than to abhor the best people.  It is as excellent to get along

Avoid committing yourself to risky enterprises.

This is one of the chief goals of prudence.  People of great talent keep
well away from extremities.  There is a long way to walk from one extreme
to another, and the prudent stick to the middle ground.  Only after long
deliberation do they decide to act, for it is easier to hide oneself from
danger than it is to overcome it.  Dangerous situations place our judgment
in jeopardy, and it is safer to flee from them entirely.  One danger leads
to another, greater one, and brings us to the edge of disaster.  Some
people are rash, because of their temperament or their national origin, and
they are quick to commit themselves and place others in danger.  But the
person who walks in the light of reason sizes up the situation and sees
that there is more courage in avoiding danger than in conquering it.  He
sees that there is already one rash fool, and avoids adding another.

choosing and choosing the best.  There are many people with a fertile,

and it would have been better to get it over with.  The mind is
bolder than the body.  So with the sword:  let it be sheathed in
prudence, ready for the occasion.  It is your defense.  A weak
spirit does more harm than a weak body.  Many people with eminent
qualities lacked this brio, appeared to be dead, and were buried

which the quality opposed acquires strength).  Difficulties bring
out the best in them.  They are monsters who succeed spontaneously

If you enter the house of Fortune through the door of pleasure,
you will leave through the door of sorrow, and vice versa.  So
be careful of the way you end things, and devote more attention

Fortunate people often have very favorable beginnings and very

Some people are born prudent.  They come into the world with an
advantage -- the good sense that is a natural part of wisdom --
and they have already walked half the road to success.  With age
and experience their reason reaches complete maturity, and their
judgment is tuned to its surroundings.  These people hate any

state, where total security is important.  Such people as these

Eminence in what is best.

Amid different sorts of perfection, this is a rarity.  There is no
hero without some sublime quality.  Mediocrity never wins applause.
Eminence at some lofty pursuit redeems us from ordinary vulgarity,
raising us to the exceptional.  To be eminent in a lowly occupation
is to be something at very little:  the more comfort, the less
glory.  To be exceptional at superior things gives you a sovereign
character:  it wins admiration and gains the goodwill of others.

This is a dangerous sort of satisfaction and it deserves a fatal
punishment.  The worth of a prime minister never detracted from the

falls upon its principal cause, as does criticism in the case of

good, or bad, ministers," but "He was a good, or bad, craftsman."  So
choose carefully, examine your ministers.  To them you are entrusting

others had not preceded them.  Those who are first are the first-
borns of fame, and the children who follow are left to file lawsuits
for their daily bread.  No matter how hard they try, they cannot
elude the vulgar accusation that they are imitators.  Prodigious,
subtle people have always invented new ways to achieve eminence,
provided that prudence makes their adventures safe.  Using novelty,
wise people have found room in the roster of heroes.  Some people

It is both beneficial and wise to steer clear of troubles.  Prudence
will save you from many:  it is the Lucina (Roman goddess of child-
birth; used as surname of Juno and Diana) of good fortune and content.
Don't give others hateful news unless there is a remedy, and be even
more careful not to receive it.  Some people's hearing is spoiled by
the sweetness of flattery, others' by hearing bitter gossip, and there
are people who cannot live without a daily dose of unpleasantness,
like Mithridates with his poison (King of Pontus, who, fearing his
enemies would poison him, accustomed himself by taking daily doses of
it).  Nor can you keep well by inflicting lifelong grief on yourself
in order to please someone else, even if he is close to you.  Never
sin against your own happiness in order to please the person who
counsels you and has nothing at stake in the matter.  When giving
pleasure to another involves giving grief to yourself, remember this
lesson:  better for the other person to feel grief now than for you
to feel it later, and with no hope.

Elevated taste.

You can cultivate it, as you can the intellect.  Full understanding
whets the appetite and desire, and, later, sharpens the enjoyment of
possession.  You can judge the height of someone's talent by what he
aspires to.  Only a great thing can satisfy a great talent.  Large
bites are for large palates, lofty matters for lofty characters.
Even the greatest excellences tremble before the person of refined
taste, and the most perfect lose their confidence.  Few things have
perfection of the first magnitude:  let your appreciation be sparing.
Taste is acquired through contact with others.  You make it your own
through continual exercise.  You are lucky if you can associate with
someone with perfectly developed taste.  But don't profess to be
satisfied with nothing; it is a foolish extreme, more odious if from
affectation than if from character.  Some wish God had created another
world and other perfections just to satisfy their own extravagant
imagination.

Most things depend upon the satisfaction of others.  Esteem is to
perfection what the zephyr is to flowers:  breath and life.  There
are occupations that enjoy universal acclaim, and others that are
more important but barely visible.  The former are seen by all, and
win common benevolence.  The latter are rarer and require more
skill, but are secret and barely perceived, venerated but not
applauded.  Among princes, the most celebrated are the victorious
ones, and that is why the kings of Aragon were so acclaimed:  as
magnanimous conquerors and warriors.  The great person should
prefer celebrated occupations that all can see and share.  Common

Make others understand.

It is more excellent than making them remember, for intelligence is
much greater than memory.  Sometimes you should remind other people,

to do things that were ripe for doing simply because it never
occurred to them.  Let friendly advice point out the advantages.
One of the greatest of gifts is to size up quickly what matters.
When this is lacking, many successes go undone.  Let the person who
has light give it to others, and let those who lack ask for it, the
former with prudence, and the latter with discretion, merely
dropping a hint.  This delicacy is especially necessary when the
person giving advice has something at stake.  It is best to show
good taste and to be more explicit only when insinuation is not
enough.  A "no" has already been given, and now you can search
skillfully for a "yes".  Most of the time things are not obtained
because they were not attempted.

There are monsters of impertinence who are always ruled by a

You can't grant everything to everybody.  Saying "no" is as
important as granting things, especially among those in command.
What matters is the way you do it.  Some people's "no" is prized
more highly than the "yes" of others:  a gilded "no" pleases
more than a curt "yes".  Many people always have "no" on their
lips, and they sour everything.  "No" is what occurs to them
first.  They may give in later, but they aren't well thought of
because they started out by being so unpleasant.  Refusal
shouldn't come in one fell blow.  Let people nibble on their
disappointment little by little.  Never refuse something completely:
others would no longer depend on you.  There should always be some
last remnants of hope to sweeten the bitterness of refusal.  Let
courtesy occupy the void where favor once stood, and good words
compensate for a lack of action.  "No" and "yes" are short words
requiring long thought.

Know when to be evasive.

It is the way the prudent get out of difficulty.  With an elegant
joke they are able to escape from the most intricate labyrinth.
One smile and they have eluded difficulty.  On this the greatest
of captains founded his courage.  A friendly way of saying no is
to change the subject, and no ploy is more clever than to pretend
it isn't you, but someone else, who is being alluded to.

Don't be unfriendly.

The wildest animals inhabit cities.  Being unapproachable is the
vice of those who lack self-knowledge and who change humors with
honors.  To begin by annoying others is no way to win renown.
Imagine one of these surly monsters, always about to turn savage
and impertinent.  His unlucky servants approach him as though he
were a tiger, arming themselves cautiously with a whip.  In order
to reach their high position they pleased everyone, and now that
they are there they want to get even by angering everyone.
Because of their position, such people ought to belong to
everyone, but their harshness and vanity makes them belong to no
one.  A courtly punishment for them:  avoid them entirely.

Choose a heroic model,

and emulate rather than imitate.  There are examples of
greatness, living texts of renown.  Let each person choose the
first in his field, not so much to follow him as to surpass
them.  Alexander cried at the tomb of Achilles, not for
Achilles but for himself, for unlike Achilles, he had not yet
been born to fame.  Nothing makes the spirit so ambitious as
the trumpet of someone else's fame.  It frightens away envy
and encourages noble deeds.

Do not always be joking.

Prudence is known for its seriousness, which wins more respect
than wit.  The person who is always joking falls laughably
short of perfection.  We treat him like a liar, never
believing him.  From one we fear deceit, from the other jest.
One never knows when jokers are exercising their judgment,
which is the same as not having any.  No humor is worse than
continual humor.  Some win a reputation for wit, and lose
their wits.  There are moments for joviality, but the rest of
the time belongs to seriousness.

Adapt yourself to everyone else.

A Proteus of discretion.  Learned with the learned, saintly

Whether you're with a serious person or a jovial one, follow
the current, and politely transform yourself.  This is

great stratagem for living prudently, and it requires much
capacity.  It is less difficult for the person with a

Skill at trying things out.

Folly always rushes into action, for all fools are bold.
Their very simplicity, which prevents them from foreseeing
danger, keeps them from worrying about their reputation.
But Prudence enters with great care.  Caution and Penetration
precede her, beating the bushes so that she can advance safely.
Discretion sentences hasty action to failure, though.  Fortune
sometimes issues a pardon.  Go slowly when you fear the depths.

toward firm ground.  These days there are pitfalls in dealing
with others, and it is bet to fathom things as you go along.

In moderation, it is a gift, not a defect.  A pinch of wit is
good seasoning.  The greatest people can parlay grace and humor

Be careful when you inform yourself about things.

Much of our lives is spent gathering information.  We see very
few things for ourselves, and live trusting others.  The ears
are the back door of truth and the front door of deceit.
Truth is more often seen than heard.  Seldom does it reach us
unalloyed, even less so when it comes from afar.  It is always
blended with the emotions it has passed through.  Emotion
taints everything it touches, making it odious or favorable.
It tries always to impress us one way or another.  Be more
careful with someone who is praising than with someone who is
criticizing.  Discover what ax he is grinding, on what side he
is limping, where he is heading.  Beware of the false and the
faulty.

Neither all bad nor all good.

A certain sage reduced the whole of wisdom to the golden mean.
Carry right too far and it becomes wrong.  The orange squeezed

shouldn't go to extremes.  The intellect itself will go dry if
pressed too hard, and if you milk a cow like a tyrant you will

Allow yourself some venial fault.

An act of carelessness can sometimes be the best way to help others
see your talents.  Envy often ostracizes people:  the more civil it
is, the more criminal.  It accuses what is perfect of sinning by
not sinning, and it condemns complete perfection.  It makes itself
into an Argos, looking for the faults in excellent things, if
only to console itself.  Like lightning, censure strikes the
highest places.  So let Homer not at times, and pretend that your
intelligence or courage -- though not your prudence -- has
committed some act of carelessness.  That way malevolence will
calm down, and not burst its bubble of poison.  This is like
waving a red cape in front of the bull of envy in order to
escape with immortality.

Know how to use your enemies.

Grasp things not by the blade, which will harm you, but by the
hilt, which will defend you.  The same applies to emulation.
The wise person finds enemies more useful than the fool does
friends.  Malevolence often levels the mountains of difficulty
that favor made fearful.  Many owe their greatness to their
enemies.  Flattery is fiercer than hatred, for hatred corrects
the faults flattery had disguised.  The prudent man makes a
mirror out of the evil eye of others, and it is more truthful
than that of affection, and helps him reduce his defects or
emend them.  One grows very cautious when living across the
border from malevolent rivals.

Don't be the wild card.

Excellent things are easily abused.  When everyone covets
something, they are easily annoyed by it.  It is a bad thing
to be good for nothing, but worse to be good for everything.
Some lose because they win so often, and soon they area as
despised as they once were desired.  Such wild cards are
found in every sort of perfection.  They lose their initial
reputation for uniqueness, and are scorned as common.  The
remedy for extremes is not to exceed the golden mean in
displaying your gifts.  Be excessive in your perfection but
moderate about showing it.  The brighter the torch, the more
it consumes itself and the less it lasts.  To win true
esteem, make yourself scarce.

Head off rumor.

The crowd is a many-headed monster:  many eyes for malice,
many tongues for slander.  Sometimes a rumor arises and
blights the best reputation, and if it sticks to you like a
nickname, your fame will perish.  The crowd usually seizes
on some outstanding weakness, or some ridiculous defect:
fit material for its murmurings.  At times it is our envious
rivals who cunningly invent these defects.  There are mean
mouths and they ruin a great reputation sooner with a joke
than with a shameless bold-faced lie.  It is very easy to
acquire a bad reputation, for badness is easily believed
and hard to erase.  Let the prudent person avoid all this,
and keep an eye on vulgar insolence; for an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Culture and refinement.

Man is born a barbarian.  Culture raises him above the beast.
Culture turns us into true persons:  the more culture, the
greater the person.  In that belief, Greece called the rest of
the universe "barbarian".  Ignorance is rough and rude.  There
is nothing more cultivating than knowledge.  But wisdom
herself is coarse when polish is lacking.  Not only must
understanding be refined, but also our desires and especially
our conversation.  Some people show a natural refinement both
in their inner and outer gifts, their concepts and words, in
their bodily adornment (which is like the bark) and their
spiritual gifts (the fruit).  Others are so gross that they
tarnish everything, even their fine qualities, with an
unbearable barbaric sloppiness.

Deal with others in a grand way.

Aspire to elevation.  The great should never be petty.  You
needn't go into all the details when conversing with others,
especially when the subject is distasteful.  Notice things,
but do so casually; it isn't good to turn conversation into
detailed interrogation.  Act with a courteous, noble
generality, which is a sort of gallantry.  A large part of
ruling lies in feigning indifference.  Learn to overlook
most of the things that happen among your close friends,
your acquaintances, and especially your enemies.
Overscrupulousness is irritating, and if it forms part of
your character you will be tiresome to others.  To keep
circling around something unpleasant is a sort of mania.
Remember that people usually behave like what they are:
according to their own heart and their own capacity.

Two things bring life to an early end:  stupidity and depravity.
Some lose their life by not knowing how to save it; others, by

Never act unless you think it prudent to do so.

If the person doing something suspects he will fail, it will be
evident to the person watching, even more so when he is a rival.
If your judgment wavers in the heat of emotion, you'll be
thought a fool when things cool down.  It is dangerous to
undertake something when you doubt its wisdom.  It would be
safer not to act at all.  Prudence refuses to deal in
probability:  it always walks under the midday sun of reason.
How can something turn out well when caution started to
condemn it the moment it was conceived?  Even resolutions
that passed the inner examination *nemine discrepante* often
turn out badly; so what can we expect from those that reason

It is more offensive to take excessive pride in your high office
than in yourself.  Don't play the "great man" -- it is odious --
and don't be proud of being envied.  The more strenuously you
seek esteem from others, the less of it you will have.  It depends
on respect.  You can't simply grab it, you have to deserve it and
wait for it.  Important occupations call for a certain gravity and
decorum.  Keep only what the occupation requires, what you need to
fulfill your obligations.  Don't squeeze it dry; help it along.
Those who want to look like hard workers give the impression that
they aren't up to their jobs.  If you want to succeed, do so using
your gifts, not your outer trappings.  Even a king ought to be

Don't go through life feeling discontent with yourself, which is
timidity, or satisfied, which is foolishness.  Self-complacency

No setback will surprise you if you fear it beforehand.  Homer
himself nodded at times, and Alexander tumbled from his estate and
from the deceit in which he was living.  Things depend on
circumstance.  Sometimes they prevail, and sometimes fail.  For a

A shortcut to becoming a true person:

put the right people beside you.  The company you keep can work
wonders.  Customs and tastes and even intelligence are transmitted
without our being aware of it.  Let the quick person join the
hesitant one, and so on, through every sort of temperament.  That
way you will achieve moderation without straining after it.  It
takes much skill to know how to adapt yourself.  The alternation
of opposites makes the universe beautiful and sustains it, and
causes even greater harmony in human customs than in nature.

similarity of temperament, race, family, country, or occupation.
In the spiritual realm, benevolence bestows talent, favor,
reputation, and merit.  Once one wins it -- and this is
difficult -- it is easily kept.  You can make an effort to win
it, but you must also know how to use it.

Plan for bad fortune while your fortune is good.

In the summer it is wise to provide for winter, and it is easier
to do so.  Favors are less expensive, and friendships abound.
It is good to save up for a rainy day:  adversity is expensive and
all is lacking.  Keep a following of friends and grateful people;
someday you will value what now seems unimportant.  Villainy has
no friends in prosperity because it refuses to recognize them.
In adversity it is the other way around.

Never compete.

When you vie with your opponents, your reputation suffers.  Your
competitor will immediately try to find your faults and discredit
you.  Few wage war fairly.  Rivalry discovers the defects that
courtesy overlooks.  Many people had a good reputation until they
acquired rivals.  The heat of opposition revives dead infamies
and digs up the stench of the past.  Competition begins by
revealing faults and rivals take advantage of everything they can
and all they ought not to.  Often they gain nothing by offending
others, only the vile satisfaction of revenge.  Revenge blows the
dust of oblivion from people's faults.  Benevolence was always
peaceable, and reputation indulgent.

Get used to the failings of your friends, family, and
acquaintances,

as you do to ugly faces.  Where there is dependence, try for
convenience.  There are nasty-minded people whom we cannot live
with and cannot live without.  It takes skill to get used to them,
as we do to ugliness, so that they won't surprise us on some dire
occasion.  At first they frighten us, but little by little they
stop looking so horrible, and caution foresees, or learns to
tolerate, their unpleasantness.

Always deal with people of principle.

Favor them and win their favor.  Their very rectitude ensures they
will treat you well even when they oppose your, for they act like
who they are, and it is better to fight with good-minded people
than to conquer the bad.  There is no way to get along with
villainy, for it feels no obligation to behave rightly.  This is
why there no true friendship among villains, and their fine words
cannot be trusted for they do not spring from honor.  Avoid the
person who has no honor, he esteems not virtue.  And honor is the
throne of integrity.

Don't talk about yourself.

You must either praise yourself, which is vanity, or criticize
yourself, which is meekness.  You show a lack of good judgment and
become a nuisance to others.  If this is important among friends,
it is even more so in high positions, where one often speaks in
public and where any appearance of vanity passes for foolishness.
Nor is it prudent to talk about people who are present.  You risk
running aground on flattery or vituperation.

Be known for your courtesy:

it alone can make you worthy of praise.  Courtesy is the best part
of culture, a kind of enchantment, and it wins the goodwill of all,
just as rudeness wins only scorn and universal annoyance.  When
rudeness comes from pride, it is detestable; when from bad breeding,
it is contemptible.  Better too much courtesy than too little, or
the same sort for everyone, for that would lead to injustice.
Treat your enemies with courtesy, and you'll see how valuable it
really is.  It costs little but pays a nice dividend:  those who
honor are honored.  Politeness and a sense of honor have this
advantage:  we bestow them on others without losing a thing.

Don't make yourself disliked.

There is no need to provoke aversion, it comes without being called.
There are many who hate for no particular reason, without knowing
how or why.  Malevolence travels much faster than the desire to
please.  A desire for vengeance will harm you more quickly and
surely than a desire for material goods.  Some want to be disliked
by all, either because they want to cause annoyance or because
they feel it.  Once hatred takes command of them, it is as hard
to get rid of as a bad reputation.  These people fear men of
judgment, despise those who speak ill, disdain the arrogant,
abominate buffoons, but they spare people of singular excellence.
Show your esteem if you want to be esteemed, and if you want to be
rewarded with success, reward others with your attention.

Live practically.

Even your knowledge should seem usual and usable, and where
knowledge is uncommon, feign ignorance.  Ways of thinking change,
and so does taste.  Don't think like an ancient; taste like a
modern.  Count heads.  That is what matters in all things.  When
you must, follow the common taste, and make your way toward
eminence.  The wise should adapt themselves to the present, even
when the past seems more attractive, both in the clothes of the
soul and in those of the body.  This rule for living holds for
everything but goodness, for one must always practice virtue.
Many things have come to seem old-fashioned:  speaking truth,
keeping your word.  Good people seem to belong to the good old
days, though they are always beloved.  If any exist, they are
rare, and they are never imitated.  What a sad age this is, when
virtue is rare and malice is common.  The prudent must live as
best they can, though not as they would like to.  May they
prefer what luck granted them to what it withheld!

Don't make much ado about nothing.

Some take nothing into account, and others want to account for
everything.  They are always talking importance, always taking
things too seriously, turning them into debate and mystery.  Few
bothersome things are important enough to bother with.  It is
folly to take to heart what you should turn your back on.  Many
things that were something are nothing if left alone, and others
that were nothing turn into much because we pay attention to them.
In the beginning it is easy to put an end to problems, but not
later.  Sometimes the cure causes the disease.  Not the least of
life's rules is to leave well enough alone.

Mastery in words and deeds.

It makes way everywhere, and quickly wins respect.  It influences
everything:  conversation, making a speech, and even walking and
looking and wanting.  It is a great victory to seize the hearts
of others.  This sort of authority doesn't originate in foolish
audacity or irritating slow-moving gravity; it is born from a
superior character abetted by merit.

A person without affectation.

The more talent, the less affectation. This is a truly vulgar
blemish, as annoying to others as it is burdensome.  It makes one
a martyr to worry, for it is a torment to have to keep up appearances.
Even great gifts seem less valuable on account of affectation,
for people attribute them to strain and artifice rather than to
natural grace, and the natural is always more pleasant than the
artificial. The affected are held as strangers to the talents 
they affect. The better you are at something, the more you should
hide your efforts, so that perfection seems to occur naturally. 
Nor should you flee affectation by affecting not to have it. 
The prudent man should never acknowledge his own merits. By 
appearing to overlook them, he will gain the attention of others. 
The eminent person who takes no notice of his own perfection is 
twice eminent. He follows his own peculiar path to applause.

Make yourself wanted.

Few have won popular favor; consider yourself fortunate if you can
win the favor of the wise. People are usually lukewarm towards
those at the end of their careers. There are ways to win and keep
the grand prize of favor. You can be outstanding in your occupation
and in your talents. A pleasant manner works too. Turn eminence
into dependence, so that people will say that the occupation needed
you, and not vice versa. Some people honor their position, others
are honored by it. It is no honor to be made good by the bad person
who succeeds you. The fact that someone else is hated doesn't mean
that you are truly wanted.

Intrinsic quality isn't enough.  Not everyone bites at substance
or looks for inner value.  People like to follow the crowd;
they go someplace because they see other people do so.  It takes
much skill to explain something's value.  You can use praise,
for praise arouses desire.  At other times you can give things a
good name (but be sure to flee from affectation).  Another trick
is to offer something to only those in the know, for *everyone*
believes himself an expert, and the person who isn't will want
to be one.  Never praise things for being easy or common:
you'll make them seem vulgar and facile.  Everybody goes for
something unique.  Uniqueness appeals both to the taste and to
the intellect.

Distinguish the man of words from the man of deeds.

It is a subtle distinction, like the distinction between the friend
who values you for yourself and the one who values your position.
Bad words, even without bad deeds, are bad enough.  But it is even
worse, when you have no bad words, to have bad deeds.  One cannot
eat words (mere wind) or live on courtesy (polite deceit).  To catch
birds with mirrors is a perfect snare.  Only the vain are satisfied
with wind.  To retain their worth, words must be backed up with
deeds.  Trees which give no fruit, only leaves, usually have no
heart and pith.  One must know which are profitable and which serve
only for shade.

One way to get things is to scorn them.  When you look for
them, they aren't there, and later, without your trying,
they come running.  Earthly things are the shadows of heavenly
ones, and they behave like shadows; they flee when you pursue
them and chase you when you flee them.  Scorn is also the
shrewdest way to take revenge.  A wise maxim:  Never defend
yourself with the pen, for this leaves a trail and glorifies
your rivals rather than punishing them for their insolence.
Unworthy people cunningly oppose the great:  they try to win
fame indirectly, without really deserving it.  Many people
would be unknown if their excellent opponents had paid them
no heed.  There is no revenge like oblivion: burying others
in the dust of their inanity.  Impudent fools, they try to
become immortal by setting fire to the wonders of the world
and of the centuries.  One way to quiet vulgar murmuring is
to ignore it.  To impugn it will harm you.  To give it credit
brings discredit on you.  Be happy that people want to
emulate you, though their breath can tarnish, if not blacken,
the greatest perfection.

Better to be prudent.  If you sharpen your wits too much, you will

not to be a pedant.  Much reasoning is a kind of disputing.  Better

When should we reason backward?

When we are spoken to with malice.  Some people reverse
everything:  yes is no and no is yes.  If they criticize
something, it means they think highly of it.  Because they
covet it for themselves, they try to discredit it for others.
Not all praise involves speaking well.  Some people avoid
praising the good by praising the bad.  If someone finds no
one bad, he can find no one good.

Don't persist in folly.

Some people commit themselves to their errors.  They act mistakenly
and consider it constancy to go on that way.  Deep inside, they
accuse themselves; but they excuse themselves to everyone else.
When they began to act foolishly, people thought them careless;
when they continue to do so, they are confirmed as fools.  Neither
the promise carelessly given nor the mistaken resolution should
bind us forever.  Some people prolong their stupidity and press
forward with their short-sightedness.  They want to be faithful
fools.

Display your gifts;

show them off.  There is a time for each one.  Take advantage; no one can
triumph every day.  There are gallant people in whom what is little truly
shines, and what is much shines bright enough to astonish.  When you have
both talent and a talent for displaying your gifts, the result is something
prodigious.  There are nations that know how to dazzle, and Spaniards do it
better than anyone else.  As soon as the world was created, there was light
to show it off.  Showing off satisfies, supplies what is missing, and gives
everything a second being, even more so when it is grounded in reality.  The
heavens, which bestow perfection, encourage us to display our gifts.  You
need skill to do so; even what is most excellent depends on circumstance and
isn't always appropriate.  Ostentation doesn't work when it is done out of
season.  Nor should we show off in an affected way, for ostentation borders on
vanity, and vanity on scorn.  It should be exercised with moderation, so as
not to turn into vulgarity, and among wise men, an excessive display of one's
gifts is not highly thought of.  It often involves a certain silent eloquence,
a bit of carelessness.  Wise dissimulation is the best way to win praise, for
privation awakens curiosity.  It takes skill not to reveal all of your
perfection at once, but to do so little by little, always adding a little
more.  Let one glorious occasion spur you on to another greater one, and the
applause given to the first heighten expectation for the others.

Moderate your opinions.

Everyone forms his ideas according to his own interests, and offers
abundant reasons to back them up.  In most people, judgment yields
to emotion.  It often happens that two people meet head-on, and
each presumes he is right.  But reason is true, and never has two
faces.  In such encounters, proceed with wisdom and caution.
Sometimes take the other side, and cautiously revise your own
opinion.  Examine your motives from the other's point of view.
That way you will neither condemn him, nor justify yourself,
blindly.

Not a braggart, but a doer.

They are proudest of their deeds who have the least reason to
be so.  They turn everything into mystery, and do it without
grace:  chameleons of applause, providing bellyfuls of
laughter.  Vanity was always annoying, but this sort is laughed
at.  Some people are like beggars of deeds, little ants piling
up honor.  You should show the least vanity about your greatest
gifts.  Content yourself with doing:  leave saying to others.
Give deeds away, don't sell them.  And don't rent golden quills
so that others can write mud, offending common sense.  Try to
be heroic rather than merely seem so.

A man of majestic gifts.

The greatest gifts make the greatest man.  One great gift surpasses
a mediocre multitude.  A certain person wanted all his things to be
large, even his ordinary utensils.  Great people should strive for
great spiritual gifts.  In God all is infinite, all immense; and
thus in a hero all must be grand and majestic, so that all his
actions and even his words can be dressed in transcendent majesty.

Always behave as though others were watching.

A man who looks after his actions sees that others see him, or will.
He knows that walls have ears, and that what is badly done is
bursting to become known.  Even when he is alone he behaves as
though all the world were watching, and knows that all will be
revealed.  He behaves as though he already had witnesses:  those
who, when they hear something, will be so later.  The person who
wanted everyone to see him didn't care when people searched his
house while sitting in their own.

Three things make a marvel,

and are at the acme of true nobility:  fertile intelligence,
deep powers of judgment, and a pleasant, relevant taste.
Imagination is a great gift, but it is greater still to
reason well and understand the good.  The intelligence should
be sharp, not laborious.  It should reside in the head, not
the backbone.  When one is twenty, the will reigns, at thirty,
the intelligence, and forty, judgment.  There are
understandings that throw off light, like the eyes of the
lynx, and they reason best in the greatest darkness.  There
are others who always hit upon what is most relevant.  Things
occur to them often and well.  O happy fertile wit!  As for
good taste, it seasons one's entire life.

Leave people hungry.

Leave nectar on their lips.  Esteem is measured in desire.
As with thirst, it is good to allay it but not quench it.
The good, if little, is twice good.  Things fall off sharply
the second time around.  Bellyfuls of pleasure are dangerous:
they cause even the most eternal eminence to be scorned.
The one rule for pleasing:  whet the appetite, keep people
hungry.  The impatience of desire will do more than the
ennui of enjoyment, and waiting deepens our pleasure.

In a word, be a saint; that says everything.

Virtue is a chain of all perfections, the center of all happiness.
She makes you prudent, discreet, shrewd, sensible, wise, brave,
cautious, honest, happy, praiseworthy, true ... a universal hero.
Three things make one blessed:  saintliness, wisdom, and prudence.
Virtue is the sun of the lesser world, and its hemisphere is a
good conscience.  It is so lovely that it wins God's grace and
that of others.  There is nothing as lovable as virtue, nor as
hateful as vice.  Virtue alone is for real; all else is sham.
Talent and greatness depend on virtue, not on fortune.  Only
virtue is sufficient unto herself.  She makes us love the living
and remember the dead.

          Right Thought;
          Right Speech;
          Right Attitude;

          Right Effort;
          Right Mindfulness;

Dear Sir:

Your name has been submitted to us with your photo.  I regret to inform you
that we will be unable to use your body in our centerfold.  On a scale of
one to ten, your body was rated a minus two by a panel of women ranging in age
from 60 to 75 years.  We tried to assemble a panel in the age bracket of 25
to 35 years, but we could not get them to stop laughing long enough to reach
a decision.  Should the taste of the American woman ever change so
drastically that bodies such as yours would be appropriate in our centerfold,
you will be notified by this office.  Please, don't call us.


Sympathetically,

Your petitioners are Atheists and they define their ideas as follows.  An
Atheist loves his fellow man instead of a god.  An Atheist knows that
heaven is something for which we should work now--here on earth--for all men
together to enjoy.  An Atheist knows that he can get no help through prayer
but that he must find within himself the inner conviction and strength to meet
life, to grapple with it, to subdue it and to enjoy it.   An Atheist knows that
only in a knowledge of himself and a knowledge of his fellow man can he find the
understanding that will help to a life of fulfillment.

An Atheist seeks to know himself then and his fellow rather than to know a
god.  An Atheist understands that a hospital must be built instead of a
church.  An Atheist knows that a deed must be done instead of a prayer said.
An Atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death.  He wants
disease conquered, poverty vanquished, war eliminated.  He wants man to
understand, love and accept all of mankind.  He wants an ethical way of life.
He knows that we cannot rely on a god, channel action into prayer, or hope for
an end to our troubles in a hereafter.  He knows that we are not only our
brother's keepers--but keepers of our own lives foremost, that we are
responsible persons and that the job is here and the time is now.

                  HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 1

proof by example:
      The author gives only the case n = 2 and suggests that it
      contains most of the ideas of the general proof.

proof by intimidation:
      'Trivial'.

proof by vigorous handwaving:
      Works well in a classroom or seminar setting.
@
                  HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 2

proof by cumbersome notation:
      Best done with access to at least four alphabets and special
      symbols.

proof by exhaustion:
      An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof is useful.

proof by omission:
      'The reader may easily supply the details'
      'The other 253 cases are analogous'
      '...'
@
                  HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 3

proof by obfuscation:
      A long plotless sequence of true and/or meaningless
      syntactically related statements.

proof by wishful citation:
      The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization of
      a theorem from the literature to support his claims.

proof by funding:
      How could three different government agencies be wrong?

proof by eminent authority:
      'I saw Karp in the elevator and he said it was probably NP-
      complete.'
@
                  HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 4

proof by personal communication:
      'Eight-dimensional colored cycle stripping is NP-complete
      [Karp, personal communication].'

proof by reduction to the wrong problem:
      'To see that infinite-dimensional colored cycle stripping is
      decidable, we reduce it to the halting problem.'

proof by reference to inaccessible literature:
      The author cites a simple corollary of a theorem to be found
      in a privately circulated memoir of the Slovenian
      Philological Society, 1883.

proof by importance:
      A large body of useful consequences all follow from the
      proposition in question.
@
                  HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 5

proof by accumulated evidence:
      Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.

proof by cosmology:
      The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or
      meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.

proof by mutual reference:
      In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in
      reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in
      reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in
      reference A.

proof by metaproof:
      A method is given to construct the desired proof. The
      correctness of the method is proved by any of these
      techniques.
@
                  HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 6

proof by picture:
      A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines well
      with proof by omission.

proof by vehement assertion:
      It is useful to have some kind of authority relation to the
      audience.

proof by ghost reference:
      Nothing even remotely resembling the cited theorem appears in
      the reference given.
@
                  HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 7
proof by forward reference:
      Reference is usually to a forthcoming paper of the author,
      which is often not as forthcoming as at first.

proof by semantic shift:
      Some of the standard but inconvenient definitions are changed
      for the statement of the result.

proof by appeal to intuition:
      Cloud-shaped drawings frequently help here.

            A Severe Strain on the Credulity

As a method of sending a missile to the higher, and even to the highest
parts of the earth's atmospheric envelope, Professor Goddard's rocket
is a practicable and therefore promising device.  It is when one
considers the multiple-charge rocket as a traveler to the moon that one
begins to doubt ... for after the rocket quits our air and really
starts on its journey, its flight would be neither accelerated nor
maintained by the explosion of the charges it then might have left.
Professor Goddard, with his "chair" in Clark College and countenancing
of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action to
re-action, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum
against which to react ... Of course he only seems to lack the
knowledge ladled out daily in high schools.

            William Safire's Rules for Writers:

Remember to never split an infinitive. The passive voice should never
be used.  Do not put statements in the negative form. Verbs have to
agree with their subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words
out.  If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great deal
of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must
not shift your point of view.  And don't start a sentence with a
conjunction.  (Remember, too, a preposition is a terrible word to end a
sentence with.)  Don't overuse exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as
close as possible, especially in long sentences, as of 10 or more
words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully, dangling participles
must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a
linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing
metaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should
be careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their
writing.  Always pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows
the verb.  Last but not least, avoid cliches like the plague; seek
viable alternatives.

After his Ignoble Disgrace, Satan was being expelled from Heaven.
As he passed through the Gates, he paused a moment in thought,
and turned to God and said, "A new creature called Man, I hear,
is soon to be created."

"This is true," He replied.

"He will need laws," said the Demon slyly.

"What!  You, his appointed Enemy for all Time!  You ask for the
right to make his laws?"

"Oh, no!"  Satan replied, "I ask only that he be allowed to
make his own."

It was so granted.

pointed out of the car window and said, "That is the most frightening
sight I have ever seen."  His companion was surprised to see nothing
more alarming than a priest in conversation with a little boy, his hand

We ought to be very grateful that we have tools.  Millions of years ago
people did not have them, and home projects were extremely difficult.
For example, when a primitive person wanted to put up paneling, he had
to drive the little paneling nails into the cave wall with his bare
fist, so generally the paneling wound up getting spattered with
primitive blood, which isn't really all that bad when you consider how
ugly paneling is to begin with.

First, a few words about tools.

Basically, a tool is an object that enables you to take advantage of
the laws of physics and mechanics in such a way that you can seriously
injure yourself.  Today, people tend to take tools for granted.  If
you're ever walking down the street and you notice some people who look
particularly smug, the odds are that they are taking tools for
granted.  If I were you, I'd walk right up and smack them in the face.

Your home electrical system is basically a bunch of wires that
bring electricity into your home and take if back out before it has a
chance to kill you.  This is called a "circuit".  The most common home
electrical problem is when the circuit is broken by a "circuit
breaker"; this causes the electricity to back up in one of the wires
until it bursts out of an outlet in the form of sparks, which can
damage your carpet.  The best way to avoid broken circuits is to change
your fuses regularly.

Another common problem is that the lights flicker.  This
sometimes means that your electrical system is inadequate, but more
often it means that your home is possessed by demons, in which case
you'll need to get a caulking gun and some caulking.  If you're not
sure whether your house is possessed, see "The Amityville Horror", a
fine documentary film based on an actual book.  Or call in a licensed
electrician, who is trained to spot the signs of demonic possession,
such as blood coming down the stairs, enormous cats on the dinette
table, etc.

Now, you might ask, "How do I get one of those complete home
tool sets for under $4?"  An excellent question.

Go to one of those really cheap discount stores where they sell
plastic furniture in colors visible from the planet Neptune and where
they have a food section specializing in cardboard cartons full of
Raisinets and malted milk balls manufactured during the Nixon
administration.  In either the hardware or housewares department,
you'll find an item imported from an obscure Oriental country and
described as "Nine Tools in One", consisting of a little handle with
interchangeable ends representing inscrutable Oriental notions of tools
that Americans might use around the home.  Buy it.

This is the kind of tool set professionals use.  Not only is it
inexpensive, but it also has a great safety feature not found in the
so-called quality tools sets: The handle will actually break right off
if you accidentally hit yourself or anything else, or expose it to
direct sunlight.

Plumbing is one of the easier of do-it-yourself activities,
requiring only a few simple tools and a willingness to stick your
arm into a clogged toilet.  In fact, you can solve many home plumbing
problems, such as annoying faucet drip, merely by turning up the
radio.  But before we get into specific techniques, let's look at how
plumbing works.

A plumbing system is very much like your electrical system,
except that instead of electricity, it has water, and instead of wires,
it has pipes, and instead of radios and waffle irons, it has faucets
and toilets.  So the truth is that your plumbing systems is nothing at
all like your electrical system, which is good, because electricity can
kill you.

If you're like most homeowners, you're afraid that many repairs
around your home are too difficult to tackle.  So, when your furnace
explodes, you call in a so-called professional to fix it.  The
"professional" arrives in a truck with lettering on the sides and
deposits a large quantity of tools and two assistants who spend the
better part of the week in your basement whacking objects at random
with heavy wrenches, after which the "professional" returns and gives
you a bill for slightly more money than it would cost you to run a
successful campaign for the U.S. Senate.

And that's why you've decided to start doing things yourself.
You figure, "If those guys can fix my furnace, then so can I.  How
difficult can it be?"

Very difficult.  In fact, most home projects are impossible,
which is why you should do them yourself.  There is no point in paying
other people to screw things up when you can easily screw them up
yourself for far less money.  This article can help you.

Electricity is actually made up of extremely tiny particles,
called electrons, that you cannot see with the naked eye unless you
have been drinking.  Electrons travel at the speed of light, which in
most American homes is 110 volts per hour.  This is very fast.  In the
time it has taken you to read this sentence so far, an electron could
have traveled all the way from San Francisco to Hackensack, New Jersey,
although God alone knows why it would want to.

The five main kinds of electricity are alternating current,
direct current, lightning, static, and European.  Most American homes
have alternating current, which means that the electricity goes in one
direction for a while, then goes in the other direction.  This prevents
harmful electron buildup in the wires.

Home centers are designed for the do-it-yourselfer who's
willing to pay higher prices for the convenience of being able to shop
for lumber, hardware, and toasters all in one location.  Notice I say
"shop for", as opposed to "obtain".  This is the major drawback of home
centers: they are always out of everything except artificial Christmas
trees.  The home center employees have no time to reorder merchandise
because they are too busy applying little price stickers to every
object--every board, washer, nail and screw--in the entire store ...
Let's say a piece in your toilet tank breaks, so you remove the
broken part, take it to the home center, and ask an employee if he has
a replacement.  The employee, who has never is his life even seen the
inside of a toilet tank, will peer at the broken part in very much the
same way that a member of a primitive Amazon jungle tribe would look at
an electronic calculator, and then say, "We're expecting a shipment of
these sometime around the middle of next week".

    A wizard is only as good as his spells," people will often say. It is
telling however, that this statement is only made by people who have never
been wizards themselves.
    Those of us who have chosen to pursue a sorcerous career know that a
knowledge of spells is only one small facet of the successful magician.
Equally vital are a quick wit, a soothing tongue, and, perhaps most
important, a thorough knowledge of back alleys, underground passageways, and
particularly dense patches of forest, for those times when the spell you

    A wizard cannot do everything; a fact most magicians are reticent
to admit, let alone discuss with prospective clients.  Still, the fact
remains that there are certain objects, and people, that are, for one

is for this group of beings that the magician learns the subtleties of
using indirect spells.  It also does no harm, in dealing with these

    A wizard's reputation is his bond, or so the sages say. And, as all
learned men know, a reputation is difficult to build, and all too easily
besmirched.  The wizard with a fallen reputation is often led to less savory
forms of employ, and, while these sometimes pay better than whatever the
wizard was doing before, they are not the sort of thing one writes home to
Mother about.  The successful wizard, therefore, should develop three or
four reputations simultaneously, and then, happily, will have one for every
occasion.

third: "The spell has not worked. Will you please pay me the rest of my
retainer before your money explodes with you?" Delivering lines like these
with conviction is the sign of a professional sorcerer.

    And what is the professional wizard's greatest reward for completing a
particularly arduous and dangerous task? Is it the accolades of a grateful
populace? Is it huge amounts of gold and silver tossed about his feet? Is it
the complementary vacation in the pleasure gardens of Vushta, or his
official removal from the tax rolls? Although all of these other factors are
important for the wizard to feel truly honored, they pale before the
professional wizard's basic and oh-so-necessary demand: The stipulation that
he never has to repeat that particularly arduous and dangerous task, or one
even remotely like it, for as long as he shall live.

when one can conjure virtually anything, what can one do to 'get away from
it all?'
    Different wizards arrive at different solutions for their entertainment.
A sorcerer of my acquaintance decided to increase his physical prowess
through a vigorous program of exercise but found that his new muscles were
wont to rip through his robes mid-conjure. Another mage decided to develop
the interplay between tongue and teeth so that he could exactly reproduce
any insect noise imaginable. He became so successful at this that they
discovered his corpse one midsummer's eve, suffocated by six thousand three
hundred and two amorous katydids. And the wizard who tried to start personal
communications between humans and sheep... well, the less said the better.

survive your current circumstances, it is often helpful to think of a
pleasant thought.
    Interviewer: Do you mean, for example, how good it will feel to
strangle, pummel, and utterly destroy my enemy?
    Ebenezum: Well, no, you do not quite have the spirit of it. Think rather
of a flower, or rather, a group of flowers. Picture bright yellow daisies,
or stately red roses, full and fragrant. And now that you have this thought in
your mind, think how lovely those flowers will look on the grave of your
enemy once he has been strangled, pummeled, and utterly destroyed. It is only
in this way that the besieged wizard may find inner peace.

lengthy retreats can deplete a wizard's fortunes, I have always preferred

"Take a wizard to lunch!" Yet I doubt this will ever occur, for wizards are
by and large a solitary breed. Still, this should not stop you from trying to

    There are as many styles of magic as there are magicians. While much of
magic is gaudy, noisy, and easily appreciated by the masses, it goes without
saying that some of the finest sorcery is also the most subtle; small,
delicate changes in the fabric of being that often can only be discerned by
another wizard's practiced eye. Occasionally, even a wizard as learned as
myself will experience a twinge of regret that I have not yet conquered some
of the most delicate aspects of my art; that, for example, I have not learned
the Eastern finger magic, where, by the turn of a knuckle, the mage may make
the flowers sing. And perhaps some day my fingers might learn that art, on the
day they become tired from constantly carrying about the large amounts of gold

    There comes a time when every wizard should retire, and pass the mantle
of responsibility on to younger shoulders. It behooves us, then, to teach our
successors well, so that the new wizard may do honor to our names, attract
the very best of clients, and be well enough paid to support our retirement
home in Vushta.

    There is talk in some learned circles in our major cities about whether
or not satyrs, centaurs, griffins and certain other fantastic beasts really
exist, or are only the product of the popular imagination. As a wizard, I, of
course, tend to side with the satyrs, centaurs and griffins, especially when
these beasts begin to doubt the existence of any learned circles in our major
cities.

    When traveling, the sages say, one must always be prepared to accept
local customs. Yet there are areas of this very kingdom where one might find it
customary to tax a wizard into poverty; to insist a wizard should not be
paid, for magic exists only for the common good; or even to tar and feather a
wizard unsuccessful at his task. Contrary to the sages, when one is traveling
in these areas, one should be prepared to avoid local customs altogether.

    Wizards are constantly subject to negative publicity. A case in point.
One elderly wizard of my acquaintance, whenever he was bothered by unexpected
guests, would immediately cast one of three spells upon them, either turning
them to stone, transforming them into segmented worms, or blasting them
entirely out of the kingdom. Now, some wrong-headed do-gooders, hearing
about the aged mage's predilections, formed an angry torch-bearing mob, forcing
the now wronged wizard to flee to a distant kingdom altogether. How much better
it would have been if the aged wizard had thought to inform the populace of the
true benefits of the spells he used on those who came to bother him! For
example, those people who have experienced it will tell you that nothing is
more restful than being turned to stone, while transformation into a worm
brings you closer to the earth. As to being totally blasted from the
wizard's domain, I challenge you: Can you think of any other way you can travel
such a great distance for free?

    Wizards encounter periods of crisis from time to time. It comes with the
job, right along with the robes and the pointy hat. Now, some wizards thrive
on crisis, and there is quite a bit of gold to be made, should the wizard
survive, by thrusting oneself into the thick of things. The more experienced
mage, however, makes ample use of soothsaying spells, so that he may collect
the monies, reassure the populace, and still have time to leave the area before
the thick of things arrives.

    Wizards, like all mortals, need their rest. Casting spells, righting
wrongs, and putting a little away for your old age can all be draining
occupations. The true wizard must therefore always insist on a good night's
sleep, and a few days' respite between tasks. After some particularly
grueling work, a couple of weeks in the country are not out of line. In the
aftermath of truly major assignments, of course, nothing less than a seaside
vacation will do. And what of those situations in which a wizard's work affects
the very world around him, perhaps the fabric of the cosmos itself? Well, be
advised that prime accommodations in Vushta must be reserved at least two
months in advance.

The big problem with pornography is defining it.  You can't just
say it's pictures of people naked.  For example, you have these
primitive African tribes that exist by chasing the wildebeest on foot,
and they have to go around largely naked, because, as the old tribal
saying goes: "N'wam k'honi soit qui mali," which means, "If you think
you can catch a wildebeest in this climate and wear clothes at the same
time, then I have some beach front property in the desert region of
Northern Mali that you may be interested in."

So it's not considered pornographic when National Geographic
publishes color photographs of these people hunting the wildebeest
naked, or pounding one rock onto another rock for some primitive reason
naked, or whatever.  But if National Geographic were to publish an
article entitled "The Girls of the California Junior College System
Hunt the Wildebeest Naked," some people would call it pornography.  But
others would not.  And still others, such as the Spectacularly Rev.
Jerry Falwell, would get upset about seeing the wildebeest naked.

       Harry was delighted when he found a young woman who accepted his
proposal of marriage, as he was sensitive about his wooden leg, and a bit
afraid no one would have him. In fact, he couldn't bring himself to tell
his fiance about his leg when he slipped the ring on her finger, nor
when she bought the dress, nor when they picked the time and place. All
he kept saying was, "Darling, I've got a big surprise for you," at which
she blushed and smiled bewitchingly.
       The wedding night came, and the young couple were at last alone in
their hotel room. "Now don't forget, Harry, you promised me a big surprise,"
said the bride.
       Unable to say a word, Harry turned out the lights, unstrapped

patron may govern the scheduled completion of the task, but it cannot
govern the actual completion. An omelet, promised in two minutes, may
appear to be progressing nicely. But when it has not set in two minutes,
the customer has two choices - wait or eat it raw.

The cook has another choice; he can turn up the heat. The result is
often an omelet nothing can save - burned in one part, raw in another.

A little retrospection shows that although many fine, useful software

As the system comes up, the component builders will from time to time

less time, for more complete and efficient test cases will usually be
available.

Each team building another component has been using the most recent
tested version of the integrated system as a test bed for debugging its
piece.  Their work will be set back by having that test bed change under
them.  Of course it must.  But the changes need to be quantized.  Then
each user has periods of productive stability, interrupted by bursts of
test-bed change.  This seems to be much less disruptive than a constant
rippling and trembling.

It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar
mistake, but it is also very memorable.  I vividly recall the night we
decided how to organize the actual writing of external specifications
for OS/360.  The manager of architecture, the manager of control
program implementation, and I were threshing out the plan, schedule,
and division of responsibilities.

The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they could
write the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months,
three more than the schedule allowed.

The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could
prepare the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating;
it would be well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.
Furthermore, if the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit
twiddling their thumbs for ten months.

To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control
program team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on
time, but would also be three months late, and of much lower quality.
I did, and it was.  He was right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack
of conceptual integrity made the system far more costly to build and
change, and I would estimate that it added a year to debugging time.

Software entities are more complex for their size than perhaps any

make the two similar parts into a subroutine -- open or closed.  In

The tar pit of software engineering will continue to be sticky for a

attempting systems just within or just beyond our reach; and software
systems are perhaps the most intricate and complex of man's

use of new languages and systems, our best adaptation of proven
engineering management methods, liberal doses of common sense, and ...
humility to recognize our fallibility and limitations.

This, then, is the demythologizing of the man-month. The number of months
of a project depends on its sequential constraints. The maximum number of
men depends on the number of independent sub-tasks... From these two
quantities one can derive schedules using fewer men and more months.  One
cannot, however, get workable schedules using more men and fewer months.
More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for
all other causes combined.

"None of our men are "experts."  We have most unfortunately found it
necessary to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert --
because no one ever considers himself expert if he really knows his job.
A man who knows a job sees so much more to be done than he has done, that
he is always pressing forward and never gives up an instant of thought to
how good and how efficient he is.  Thinking always ahead, thinking always
of trying to do more, brings a state of mind in which nothing is
impossible. The moment one gets into the "expert" state of mind a great
number of things become impossible."

outside the formal sessions whenever anyone asks me a question or starts to
tell me about his "work." The "work" is always: (1) completely
un-understandable, (2) vague and indefinite, (3) something correct that is
obvious and self-evident, but worked out by a long and difficult analysis,
and presented as an important discovery, (4) a claim based on the stupidity
of the author that some obvious and correct fact, accepted and checked for
years, is, in fact, false (these are the worst, no argument will convince
the idiot), (5) an attempt to do something probably impossible, but
certainly of no utility, which, it is finally revealed at the end, fails, or
(6) just plain wrong. There is a great deal of "activity in the field" these
days, but this "activity" is mainly in showing that the previous "activity"
of somebody else resulted in an error or in nothing useful or in something

It can be seen from 10,000 feet, silhouetted against the snow.

A group of programmers were presenting a report to the Emperor.  "What was
the greatest achievement of the year?" the Emperor asked.

The programmers spoke among themselves and then replied, "We fixed 50% more
bugs this year than we fixed last year."

The Emperor looked on them in confusion.  It was clear that he did not know
what a "bug" was.  After conferring in low undertones with his chief
minister, he turned to the programmers, his face red with anger.  "You are
guilty of poor quality control.  Next year there will be no 'bugs'!" he
demanded.

And sure enough, when the programmers presented their report to the Emperor
the next year, there was no mention of bugs.

A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him
invented a new program that became popular and sold well. As a result,
the manager retained his job.

The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer
refused it, saying, "I wrote the program because I thought it was an
interesting concept, and thus I expect no reward."

The manager upon hearing this remarked, "This programmer, though he
holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of
an employee.  Let's promote him to the exalted position of management
consultant!"

But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, "I exist
so that I can program.  If I were promoted, I would do nothing but waste
everyone's time.  May I go now? I have a program that I'm working on."

Green Grass and High Tides Forever       The Outlaws

In a place you only dream of, where your soul is always free,
Silver stages, golden curtains, filled my head plain as could be.
As a rainbow grew around the sun, all the stars I've loved who died,
Came from somewhere beyond the scene you see,
These lovely people played just for me.

Now if I let you see this place, where stories all ring true,
Then will you let me past your face to see what's really you?
It's not for me I ask this quest, as though I was a king,
For you have to love, believe and feel,
before the burst of tambourines takes you there.

           Green Grass and High Tides Forever
<chorus>   Castles of stone souls and glory
           Lost faces say we adore you
           As kings and queens bow and play for you

Those who don't believe me, find you souls and set them free.
Those who do, believe and love, as time will be your key.
Time and time again I've thanked them for a piece of mind.
They helped me find myself amongst the music,
And the rhyme that enchants you there.

A scientist is trying to determine how much each of a frog's
legs contribute to the frog's ability to jump. He places a frog
on a calibrated screen and claps his hands.

  "Frog, Jump!," he yells.

The frog leaps into the air. The scientist notes where he lands
in his book - with 4 legs frog jumps 20 inches. He then removes
one leg and repeats the test.

  "Frog, Jump!," he yells as he claps his hands.

The frog once again leaps into the air. Once more the scientist
notes the results in his book - with 3 legs frog jumps 15 inches.
The experiment is repeated until all of the frogs legs have been
removed. The scientist places the frog on the test stand one last
time.

  "Frog, Jump!," he yells and claps.

There is no response.

  "Frog, Jump!," he yells louder.

Again there is no response. After several more tries at prompting
the frog, the scientist gives up with a sigh. He notes in his
book - with no legs frog is deaf.

Business Week, October 17:

Laura Newman's business is selling information on local real-estate
transactions.  But when she was working out of her home, people calling for
information thought she was a flake.  In the background they'd hear a baby
crying or a TV blaring.  Not very impressive.  She solved the problem by
playing a tape of typical office sounds: clacking typewriters, ringing
phones, etc.  It was so convincing that clients would apologize for calling
at a busy time.

My father had the spirit and integrity of a scientist, but he was a

I remember asking him the question "How can a man of integrity be a
salesman?"

He said to me, "Frankly, many salesmen in the business are not
straightforward -- they think it's a better way to sell.  But I've tried
being straightforward, and I find it has its advantages.  In fact, I
wouldn't do it any other way.  If the customer thinks at all, he'll
realize he has had some bad experience with another salesman, but hasn't
had that kind of experience with you.  So in the end, several customers
will stay with you for a long time and appreciate it."

@
The only way to have real success in science, the field I'm familiar with,
is to describe the evidence very carefully without regard to the way you feel
it should be.  If you have a theory, you must try to explain what's good and
what's bad about it equally.  In science, you learn a kind of standard
integrity and honesty.

In other fields, such as business, it's different.  For example, almost
every advertisement you see is obviously designed, in some way or another,
to fool the customer: the print that they don't want you to read is small; the
statements are written in an obscure way.  It is obvious to anybody that the
product is not being presented in a scientific and balanced way.  Therefore,
in the selling business, there's a lack of integrity.

Cartoon Law I.
    Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made
    aware of its situation.
    Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland.
    He loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he
    chances to look down.  At this point, the familiar principle
    of 32 feet per second per second takes over.
@
Cartoon Law II.
    Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter
    intervenes suddenly.
    Whether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit on foot, cartoon
    characters are so absolute in their momentum that only a
    telephone pole or an outsize boulder retards their forward
    motion absolutely.  Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden
    termination of motion the stooge's surcease.
@
Cartoon Law III.
    Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation
    conforming to its perimeter.
    Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the
    specialty of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of
    reckless cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit
    directly through the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout-
    perfect hole.  The threat of skunks or matrimony often
    catalyzes this reaction.
@
Cartoon Law IV.
    The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater
    than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the
    ledge to spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it
    unbroken.  Such an object is inevitably priceless, the attempt to capture
    it inevitably unsuccessful.
@
Cartoon Law IX.
    For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite re-vengeance.
    This is the one law of animated cartoon motion that also
    applies to the physical world at large.  For that reason,
    we need the relief of watching it happen to a duck instead.
@
Cartoon Law V.
    All principles of gravity are negated by fear.
    Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to
    propel them directly away from the earth's surface.  A spooky
    noise or an adversary's signature sound will induce motion
    upward, usually to the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or
    the crest of a flagpole.  The feet of a character who is
    running or the wheels of a speeding auto need never touch
    the ground, especially when in flight.
@
Cartoon Law VI.
    As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.
    This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in
    which a character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the
    cloud of altercation at several places simultaneously.  This
    effect is common as well among bodies that are spinning or
    being throttled.  A 'wacky' character has the option of self-
    replication only at manic high speeds and may ricochet off
    walls to achieve the velocity required.
@
Cartoon Law VII.
    Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble
    tunnel entrances; others cannot.
    This trompe l'oeil inconsistency has baffled generation, but
    at least it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a
    wall's surface to trick an opponent will be unable to pursue
    him into this theoretical space.  The painter is flattened
    against the wall when he attempts to follow into the painting.
    This is ultimately a problem of art, not of science.
@
Cartoon Law VIII.
    Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent.
    Cartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional
    nine lives might comfortably afford.  They can be decimated,
    spliced, splayed, accordion-pleated, spindled, or
    disassembled, but they cannot be destroyed.  After a few
    moments of blinking self pity, they reinflate, elongate,
    snap back, or solidify.

Corollary: A cat will assume the shape of its container.

Great Rules for writing from William Safire in the New York Times:

* Do not put statements in the negative form.
* And don't start sentences with a conjunction.
* It is incumbent on one to avoid archaisms.
* If you reread your work, you will find on rereading that a great deal
   of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.
* Never use a long word when a diminutive one will do.
* Unqualified superlatives are the worst of all.
* De-accession euphemisms.
* If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a linking verb is.
* Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.
* Never, ever use repetitive redundancies.
* Also, avoid awkward or affected alliteration.
* Last, but not least, avoid cliches like the plague.

Hi, I'm Preston A. Mantis, president of Consumers Retail Law Outlet.
As you can see by my suit and the fact that I have all these books of
equal height on the shelves behind me, I am a trained legal attorney.
Do you have a car or a job?  Do you ever walk around?  If so, you
probably have the makings of an excellent legal case.  Although of
course every case is different, I would definitely say that based on my
experience and training, there's no reason why you shouldn't come out
of this thing with at least a cabin cruiser.

I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments of
others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the use
of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion,
such as "certainly", "undoubtedly", etc.  I adopted instead of them "I
conceive", "I apprehend", or "I imagine" a thing to be so or so; or "so it
appears to me at present".

When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied myself the
pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him immediately some
absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by observing that in
certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present
case there appeared or seemed to me some difference, etc.

I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I
engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I proposed my
opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.  I had
less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I
happened to be in the right.

I myself have dreamed up a structure intermediate between Dyson spheres
and planets.  Build a ring 93 million miles in radius -- one Earth orbit
-- around the sun.  If we have the mass of Jupiter to work with, and if
we make it a thousand miles wide, we get a thickness of about a thousand
feet for the base.

And it has advantages.  The Ringworld will be much sturdier than a Dyson
sphere.  We can spin it on its axis for gravity.  A rotation speed of 770
m/s will give us a gravity of one Earth normal.  We wouldn't even need to
roof it over.  Place walls one thousand miles high at each edge, facing the
sun.  Very little air will leak over the edges.

Lord knows the thing is roomy enough.  With three million times the surface
area of the Earth, it will be some time before anyone complains of the
crowding.

to death, but gets a choice of how he (or she) will die.

The first explorer asks for death by alcohol. The natives bring him
their local paint remover and he drinks himself into a stupor, gets
alcohol poisoning and dies. They take his body, skin it and make it into
a canoe.

The second explorer chooses death by overdose. They bring him so
cocaine, and he proceeds to OD. Once again, the natives skin him and
make him into a canoe.

The third explorer is asked how he wants to die. He asks for death by
fork.  The natives are puzzled, death by fork?. Yes he replies, so they
bring him a large fork. He immediately starts puncturing himself all
over him body and yells,

"Here's your freakin' canoe!"

Our [softball] team usually puts the other woman at second base, where
the maximum possible number of males can get there on short notice to
help out in case of emergency.  As far as I can tell, our second
basewoman is a pretty good baseball player, better than I am, anyway,
but there's no way to know for sure because if the ball gets anywhere
near her, a male comes barging over from, say, right field, to deal
with it.  She's been on the team for three seasons now, but the males
still don't trust her.  They know, deep in their souls, that if she had
to choose between catching a fly ball and saving an infant's life, she
probably would elect to save the infant's life, without ever
considering whether there were men on base.

Most fish live underwater, which is a terrible place to have sex
because virtually anywhere you lie down there will be stinging crabs
and large quantities of little fish staring at you with buggy little
eyes.  So generally when two fish want to have sex, they swim around
and around for hours, looking for someplace to go, until finally the
female gets really tired and has a terrible headache, and she just
dumps her eggs right on the sand and swims away.  Then the male, driven
by some timeless, noble instinct for survival, eats the eggs.  So the
truth is that fish don't reproduce at all, but there are so many of
them that it doesn't make any difference.

Lobster:
       Everyone loves these delectable crustaceans, but many cooks are
squeamish about placing them into boiling water alive, which is the
only proper method of preparing them.  Frankly, the easiest way to
eliminate your guilt is to establish theirs by putting them on trial
before they're cooked.  The fact is, lobsters are among the most
ferocious predators on the sea floor, and you're helping reduce crime
in the reefs.  Grasp the lobster behind the head, look it right in its
unmistakably guilty eyestalks and say, "Where were you on the night of
the 21st?", then flourish a picture of a scallop or a sole and shout,
"Perhaps this will refresh that crude neural apparatus you call a
memory!"  The lobster will squirm noticeably.  It may even take a swipe
at you with one of its claws.  Incorrigible.  Pop it into the pot.
Justice has been served, and shortly you and your friends will be,

you think something's wrong?  Do you think she wants us to follow her?
What is it, girl?", etc., as if this had never happened before, instead

If you have received a letter inviting you to speak at the dedication of a
new cat hospital, and you hate cats, your reply, declining the invitation,
does not necessarily have to cover the full range of your emotions.  You must
make it clear that you will not attend, but you do not have to let fly at cats.
The writer of the letter asked a civil question; attack cats, then, only if
you can do so with good humor, good taste, and in such a way that your answer
will be courteous as well as responsive.  Since you are out of sympathy with
cats, you may quite properly give this as a reason for not appearing at the
dedication ceremonies of a cat hospital.  But bear in mind that your opinion
of cats was not sought, only your services as a speaker.  Try to keep things
straight.

If you lend a person any money, it becomes lost for any purposes of your
own.  When you ask for it back again, you find a friend made an enemy by
your own kindness.  If you begin to press still further--either you must
part with that which you have entrusted, or else you must lose that
friend.

If you wind up with a boring, miserable life because you listened to your
mother, your Dad, your priest, to some guy on television, to any of the
people telling you how to do your shit, then you *deserve* it.  If you

from other people -- a schmuck is a schmuck.

In this enlightened age there are few, I believe, but what
will acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral
and political evil in any country.  It is useless to expiate
on its disadvantages.  I think it, however, a greater evil

are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies
are more strong for the former.

It is a great mistake for men to give up paying compliments, for when
they give up saying what is charming, they give up thinking what is
charming.
              -- Oscar Wilde (1854-1900)
@
It is a hard matter, my fellow citizens,
to argue with the belly, since it has no ears.
              -- Marcus Porcius Cato (95-46 B.C.)
@
It is a lesson which all history teaches wise men, 
to put trust in ideas, and not in circumstances.
              -- Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)
@
It is a rather pleasant experience to be alone in a bank at night.
              -- Willie Sutton, bank robber
@
It is advocacy of revolution by force and violence to write: "I hold a
little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the
political world as storms in the physical."  Out go the works of Thomas
Jefferson.  It is advocacy of change of government by assassination to
say, "The right of nation to kill a tyrant in cases of necessity can no
more be doubted than to hang a robber, or kill a flea."  Jefferson is
followed by his old antagonist, John Adams, the author of the Sedition
Law of 1798.
              -- Zechariah Chaffe, Jr. (1885-1957)
@
It is against the grain of modern education to teach children to
program.  What fun is there in making plans, acquiring discipline in
organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be
self-critical?
              -- Alan J. Perlis
@
It is almost always dangerous to be right too soon.
              -- Solomon Short
@
It is almost impossible systematically to constitute a natural moral
law.  Nature has no principles. She furnishes us with no reason to
believe that human life is to be respected. Nature, in her indifference,
makes no distinction between good and evil.
@
It is always better to proceed on the basis of a recognition of what is,
rather than what ought to be.
              -- Stewart Alsop
@
It is always better to sacrifice your opponent's men
@
It is always easier to believe than to deny.  Our minds are naturally
affirmative.
              -- John Burroughs (1837-1921)
@
It is always preferable to visit home with a friend.  Your parents will
not be pleased with this plan, because they want you all to themselves
and because in the presence of your friend, they will have to act like
mature human beings ...
              -- Playboy, January 1983
@
It is always the best policy to speak the truth,
unless of course you are an exceptionally good liar.
              -- Jerome K. Jerome
@
It is amazing how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness.
@
It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.
              -- Harry S. Truman
@
It is annoying to be honest to no purpose.
              -- Publius Ovidius Naso (Ovid)
@
It is better to be feared than loved,
more prudent to be cruel than compassionate.
              -- Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527)
@
It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
              -- Emiliano Zapata 
@
It is better to forgive and forget than to let everyone know it was your
mistake in the first place.
@
It is better to prevent crimes than to punish them.
              -- Cesare Bonesana di Beccaria (1738?-1794)
@
It is by acts and not by ideas that people live.
              -- Anatole France (1844-1924)
@
It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover.
              -- Henri Poincare
@
It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain
opinions makes it impossible to earn a living.
              -- Bertrand Russell (1872-1967)
@
It is common sense to take a method and try it.  If it fails, admit it
frankly and try another.  But above all, try something.
              -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945), Speech, 22 May 1932
@
It is contrary to reasoning to say that there
is a vacuum or space in which there is absolutely nothing.
              -- Descartes
@
It is difficult to retain what you may have learned unless you should
practice it.
              -- Pliny the Younger
@
It is easier to fight for principles than to live up to them.
              -- Alfred Adler (1870-1937), 1939
@
It is easier to love humanity than to love one's neighbor.
              -- Eric Hoffer
@
It is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end.
              -- Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)
@
It is easy to be brave from a safe distance.
              -- Aesop (620-560 B.C.)
@
It is far safer to be feared than loved.
              -- Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527)
@
It is folly for an eminent man to think of escaping censure, and a
weakness to be affected with it.  All the illustrious persons of
antiquity, and indeed of every age in the world, have passed through
this fiery persecution.
              -- Joseph Addison
@
It is foolish to fear that which you cannot avoid.
              -- Publilus Syrus
@
It is good that the young are beautiful; it is the only advantage they
have.
              -- The Duchess of Windsor
@
It is good to be without vices, but it is not good to be without temptations.

       (2) It reduces anxiety by reducing the expected quality of the
           project from the best of all possible efforts to the best
           that can be expected given the limited time.
       (3) Status is gained in the eyes of others, and in one's own
           eyes, because it is assumed that the importance of the work
           justifies the stress.
       (4) Avoidance of interruptions including the assignment of other
           duties can usually be achieved, so that the obviously
           stressed worker can concentrate on the single effort.

           that there is nothing important to do.
       (6) It may eliminate the job if the need passes before the job
           can be done.

chasing after him.  coming to a cliff, he caught hold of a wild vine
and swung himself over the edge.  The tiger sniffed at him from above.

come, waiting to eat him.  Two mice, one white and one black, little

Nasrudin used to take a donkey across a frontier every day, with
the panniers loaded with straw.  Since he admitted to being a smuggler
when he trudged home every night, the guards searched him again and
again.  They frisked him, sifted the straw, even tried burning it.
They found nothing, but as time went by Nasrudin became more and
more prosperous.  Many years later, in another country, a retired
customs guard met Nasrudin and asked him what he had been smuggling.
"Donkeys" was the reply.

Nasrudin was taking a load of salt to market.  His donkey waded through
a stream, dissolving the salt.  Delighted to be relieved of his load,

drowned from the weight of the wool after wetting it in the stream.

Perhaps the best way to characterize the relationship between DNA and meaning
is to say that DNA is the source of meaning.  It takes information about the
environment and turns it into behavior - thus realizing meaning in the
pragmatic sense of the word.  DNA is the place where the two sides of meaning
meet, the place where reports become instructions.  DNA is thus what first
gave meaning to life; or, perhaps, what first created meaning, and therefore
life, or what first created life, and therefore meaning.  In any event, it is
very impressive stuff.

Pompoir:  The most sought-after feminine sexual response of all.

'She must... close and constrict the Yoni until it holds the Lingam as
with a finger, opening and shutting at her pleasure, and finally acting
as the hand of the Gopala-girl who milks the cow.  This can be learned
only by long practice, and especially by throwing the will into the part
affected, even as men endeavor to sharpen their hearing ...Her husband
will then value her above all other women, nor would he exchange her for
the most beautiful queen in the Three Worlds... Among some races the
constrictor vaginae muscles are abnormally developed.  In Abyssinia for
instance, a woman can so exert them as to cause pain to a man, and when
sitting on his thighs, she can induce orgasm without moving any other
part of her person.  Such an artist is called by the Arabs Kabbazah,
literally, a holder, and its not surprising that slave dealers pay large
sums for her' Thus Richard Burton.  It has nothing to do with 'race' but

Prohibition will work great injury to the cause of temperance.  It is a
species of intemperance within itself, for it goes beyond the bounds of
reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation,
and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes.  A Prohibition law
strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was
founded.

Proof techniques #1: Proof by Induction. This technique is used on equations
with "n" in them.  Induction techniques are very popular, even the military
uses them.
SAMPLE: Proof of induction without proof of induction.
We know it's true for n equal to 1.  Now assume that it's true for every
natural number less than n.  N is arbitrary, so we can take n as large as we
want.  If n is sufficiently large, the case of n+1 is trivially equivalent, so
the only important n are n less than n.  We can take n = n (from above), so
it's true for n+1 because it's just about n. QED. (QED translates from the
Latin as "So what?")

       Blatant assertion
       Changing all the 2's to n's
       Mutual consent
       Lack of a counterexample, and
       "It stands to reason"
@
Proof techniques #2: Proof by Oddity.
       SAMPLE: To prove that horses have an infinite number of legs.
(1) Horses have an even number of legs.
(2) They have two legs in back and fore legs in front.
(3) This makes a total of six legs, which certainly is an odd number of
    legs for a horse.
(4) But the only number that is both odd and even is infinity.
(5) Therefore, horses must have an infinite number of legs.

  Managers are for dealing with the bozos in Personnel, bean counters, senior
  planners and other mental defectives.

REAL PROGRAMMERS know every nuance of every instruction and use them all in
  every real program. Puppy architects won't allow execute instructions to
  address another execute as the target instruction. REAL PROGRAMMERS despise

Review Questions

(1) If Nerd on the planet Nutley starts out in his spaceship at 20 KPH,
    and his speed doubles every 3.2 seconds, how long will it be before
    he exceeds the speed of light?  How long will it be before the
    Galactic Patrol picks up the pieces of his spaceship?

(2) If Roger Rowdy wrecks his car every week, and each week he breaks
    twice as many bones as before, how long will it be before he breaks
    every bone in his body?  How long will it be before they cut off
    his insurance?  Where does he get a new car every week?

(3) If Johnson drinks one beer the first hour (slow start), four beers
    the next hour, sixteen beers the next, etc., and stacks the cans as
    a pyramid, how soon will Johnson's pyramid be larger than King
    Tut's?  When will it fall on him?  Will he notice?

       5) Beware of alleged needs that have no market.
       6) The competition really can have lower prices.
       7) The number of competitors never declines.
       8) Secret negotiations are usually neither.
       9) If the customer wants vanilla, give him vanilla.
       10) If the customer buys lunch, you've lost the order.

Smith and Dunbar were on a cruise up the Nile.  Though good friends,
they had a falling out over a woman.  Enraged, Smith, much the larger
and stronger of the two, took hold of his friend and threw him bodily
into the river, in amongst the crocodiles.

Within moments Smith was filled with remorse.  He made the captain stop,
and went back in a dinghy to search for his friend, but had no luck.  He
left the cruise and spent the next month looking for Dunbar -- no luck.

Smith went back to Cairo.  There he heard rumors that Dunbar had
survived and was in town.  A long search proved futile, so Smith hired a
private detective.  In a few days the detective found Dunbar, still very
jittery from his terrible experience and drinking heavily.  He reported
back to Smith:

The GRPNAM privilege is an evil demon, allowing the user to
invoke its secret entrance for all manner of nefarious

The great wizard VMS confronted the demon, raised his great
oaken staff carved in ancient runes, and spoke the magic
incantation:

There was a blinding flash of light and puff of smoke, and
the demon, reduced to harmlessness, scurried off into the
distance.

Where his secret entrance had been was naught but a little
pile of ashes, which the wind slowly drifted into letters
spelling the words "FIXED IN V2.3".

heard the analogy, the answer is shattering.  Today you would be able
to buy a Rolls-Royce for $2.75, it would do three million miles to the
gallon, and it would deliver enough power to drive the Queen Elizabeth

coin, placed on their forehead, with their eyes closed, into the top of

Taking a day off, Jesus and St. Peter decide to play golf.  At one part
of the course, they came up to a short shot over a shallow pond.  St
Peter tees up first.  He stops and thinks for a moment and then states,
"I'm going to use a 6 iron."  St. Peter swings and lands a beautiful
shot about three feet away from the cup.

Jesus tees up next. He ponders the shot, and then declares, "Jack
Nicholas would use a 7 iron."  He takes his 7 iron, pulls back, and
swings.  The ball goes too high in the air and lands in the middle of
the pond.  Jesus casually walks on the water, retrieves his ball, and
tees up.  He swings and, again, his shot ends up in the pond.

"Why don't you use a 6 iron?" asked St. Peter.

"No!" retorts Jesus.  "Jack Nicholas would use a 7!"

This goes on for several shots - swing, splash, walk on water, recover
ball, and tee up again.  By this time, other golfers have caught up to
Jesus and St.  Peter.  After watching Jesus walk on water several times
to retrieve is ball one baffled golfer turns to St. Peter and asks, "Who
does that guy think he is?  Jesus Christ?"

"No," replies St. Peter. "Jack Nicholas."

side upon the other shoulder."  The defendant was acquitted by

being only an inference.

3:    Prove to thyself that all circuits that radiateth, and upon
       which the worketh, are grounded and thusly tagged lest they lift
       thee to a radio frequency potential and causeth thee to make like
       a radiator too.

The Dry Ice Time Bomb

Get a small plastic container with lid (back in the metallurgy dept. at
OSU, we used the small plastic cans that hold the coaters used for
large-format Polaroid film, because we had jillions of 'em lying
around. A film cannister would probably work; the key is, it should seal
tightly and take a fair amount of effort to open).

Now, place a chunk of dry ice in the can, and put on the lid without
quite sealing it. Put the assembled, bomb, time-delay, CO2, M1A1 in your
pocket, or behind your back.

Approach the victim and engage in normal conversation. When his
attention is drawn away, quickly seal the lid on the bomb, deposit it
somewhere within a few feet of the victim, out of obvious sight, and
then leave.

Depending on variables (you'll want to experiment, first), you'll hear a
loud "pop" and an even louder "Aarrggghhh! " within a minute, when the
dry ice warms and the CO2 pressure becomes sufficient to blow off the
lid.

In a cluttered film lab, this is doubly nasty, because the odds are the
victim will never figure out what made the noise.

The birds are singing, the flowers are budding, and it is time for Miss
Manners to tell young lovers to stop necking in public.

It's not that Miss Manners is immune to romance.  Miss Manners has been
known to squeeze a gentleman's arm while being helped over a curb, and,
in her wild youth, even to press a dainty slipper against a foot or two

people strolling hand in hand or arm in arm or arm in hand dresses up a
city considerably more than the more familiar sight of people shaking
umbrellas at one another.  What Miss Manners objects to is the kind of
activity that frightens the horses on the street ...

The first Great Steward, Parrafin the Climber, was employed in King
Chloroplast's kitchen as second scullery boy when the old King met a
tragic death.  He apparently fell backward by accident on a dozen salad
forks.  Simultaneously the true heir, his son Carotene, mysteriously
fled the city, complaining of some sort of plot and a lot of
threatening notes left on his breakfast tray.  At the time, this looked
suspicious what with his father's death, and Carotene was suspected of
foul play.  Then the rest of the King's relatives began to drop dead
one after the other in an odd fashion.  Some were found strangled with
dishrags and some succumbed to food poisoning.  A few were found
drowned in the soup vats, and one was attacked by assailants unknown
and beaten to death with a pot roast.  At least three appear to have
thrown themselves backward on salad forks, perhaps in a noble gesture
of grief over the King's untimely end.  Finally there was no one left
in Minas Troney who was either eligible or willing to wear the accursed
crown, and the rule of Twodor was up for grabs.  The scullery slave
Parrafin bravely accepted the Stewardship of Twodor until that day when
a lineal descendant of Carotene's returns to reclaim his rightful
throne, conquer Twodor's enemies, and revamp the postal system.

The following is a BMW ad that appeared in the GLOBE and MAIL
last April 1. It was a "genuine" BMW ad.


BMW INTRODUCES ITS NEWEST INNOVATION: ROAD WARMERS.

       Having spend the last twenty years perfecting the sports sedan,
BMW has now taken up the ultimate challenge - perfecting the road.

       Road Warmers are the result of twenty years of German engineering.
And represent perhaps the single most important contribution to the
automotive industry in the past decade.

       Road Warmers employ laser technology to ensure constant road
conditions. The way in which they operate is simple. Underneath the
car, four pivoting convex lasers are mounted in front of each wheel.

       The lasers are aimed at the pavement directly in front of the
tread stance. They work in tandem with five speed turbo fans. So not
only do they manage to melt snow and ice, they also dry the road of
excess moisture. And virtually eliminate the need to clear your
driveway during winter.

       Inside the car, the driver is continually apprised of climatic
conditions through BMW's onboard computer and Active Check Control.
This enables the driver to set the road to a temperature that best
suits their level of performance.

       The result is a road that never changes. Four seasons become one.
And performance is assured like never before. Eventually Road Warmers
will be standard on all new BMWs. But as part of a special offer,
your dealer will install them on your present car free of charge.

       But you should hurry. Currently offer is only available April
1st, so you would be a fool to miss this one.

Attorney: "At the scene of the accident, did you tell the constable
you had never felt better in your life?"

Farmer: "That's right."

Attorney: "Well, then, how is it that you are now claiming you were
seriously injured when my client's auto hit your wagon?"

Farmer: "When the constable arrived, he went over to my horse, who
had a broken leg, and shot him.  Then he went over to Rover, my dog,
who was all banged up, and shot him.  When he asked me how I felt, I
just thought under the circumstances, it was a wise choice of words
to say I've never felt better in my life.

The following is quoted from an interview with Freeman Dyson
in the Spring 1988 TECHNE Journal of Technological Studies from the
VTS department at Stanford.

There are lots of idiots, of course, in NASA, but my view of NASA
is rather like the Royal Air Force used to be in the old days
when I worked for the Royal Air Force during the war.  If you had an
officer who was a dud, you put him in the command headquarters because
he would do less damage there than he would out in the squadrons.
So all the duds accumulated at the headquarters - this is what has
happened at NASA for the last thirty years or so.  Actually, there are
lots of very fine things, but they're all out in the stations.  If
you look at JPL out here in California, or you look at Goddard which is
in Maryland, they're doing very well.  I think JPL is running the Voyager
missions, which of course have been beautifully done.  The Voyager went
to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and will go to Neptune next year.
That's a fantastically good mission, which is run at JPL, and then there is
the IUE, run at Goddard.  So there are these very good, what NASA calls,
the centers, these places where the technical work is done.  And there
is this terrible bunch of idiots in Washington at the headquarters which
messes everything up.  So I think if you just abolish the Washington
office, NASA would be in very good shape.

We actually tried that out during World War II.  There was a very
analogous problem we had in 1943.  The German armaments industry was
doing very well, they were producing a tremendous lot of armaments and
we wanted to put a stop to that.  We found out that all the head
offices of these armament firms were in Dusseldorf and that was where
all the paperwork was done.  So we decided we would really destroy
Dusseldorf and disorganize the whole system.  We went in there one
night and it was a very successful operation and Dusseldorf really burned
down to the ground.  And then, in the next few weeks, the armament
production went up like a rocket.

The language provides a programmer with a set of conceptual tools; if

The largest gay community in the U.S. (as a percentage of total population) is
not in San Francisco, but in Iowa Falls, Minnesota (pop. 763), a small town in
which virtually everyone is gay.  In 1976, a group of about 100 gays fleeing
persecution in the South settled in the town, and soon won a majority on the
town council.  Ordinances prohibiting heterosexual acts soon followed.  "After
all," said mayor Harry Whalen, "If the Supreme Court has refused to strike down
laws prohibiting homosexual acts, then our anti-straight laws are equally
valid."  Rigorous enforcement of those laws has resulted in a community that is
now almost 100% gay.  Said one long-time resident: "I've lived here 35 years
and didn't want to leave, but I didn't want to give up sex either.  Then my
neighbor Ed came over one night, and said how about I do it with him, and my
wife Millie could do it with his wife.  Well, I found it wasn't nearly as bad
as I thought it was gonna be.  Fact is, I rather like it."

The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events,
the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the
side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For
him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an
independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a
personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted,
in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take
refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been
able to set foot.

But I am persuaded that such behavior on the part of the
representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also
fatal.  For a doctrine which is able to maintain itself not in clear
light, but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on
mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress.  In their struggle
for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to
give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source
of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast powers in the
hands of priests.  In their labors they will have to avail themselves
of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True,
and the Beautiful in humanity itself.  This is, to be sure, a more
difficult but an incomparably more worthy task.

on a buying trip.  As he was checking into a hotel he struck up an

picture of a taxi.  She smiled, nodded her head and they went for a
ride in the park.  Later, he drew a picture of a table in a restaurant
with a question mark and she nodded, so they went to dinner.  After
dinner he sketched two dancers and she was delighted.  They went to
several nightclubs, drank champagne, danced and had a glorious
evening.  It had gotten quite late when she motioned for the pencil and
drew a picture of a four-poster bed.  He was dumbfounded, and has never

the other, whom he assumes to have perfect vision.  Each tends to
ascribe to the other side a consistency, foresight and coherence that
its own experience belies.  Of course, even two blind men can do
enormous damage to each other, not to speak of the room.

The telephone blasted Peter Fallow awake inside an egg with the shell peeled

The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed.  Our
authority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as
the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as
the light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much
radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much
as the Earth does from the Sun, or 50 times in all.  The light we
receive from the Moon is one 1/10,000 of the light we receive from the
Sun, so we can ignore that ... The radiation falling on Heaven will
heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to
the heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven loses 50 times as much
heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for
radiation, (_H/_E)^4 = 50, where _E is the absolute temperature of the
earth (-300K), gives _H as 798K (525C).  The exact temperature of Hell
cannot be computed ... [However] Revelations 21:8 says "But the
fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their part in the lake which
burneth with fire and brimstone."  A lake of molten brimstone means
that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, 444.6C.  We
have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.

The time was the 19th of May, 1780.  The place was Hartford, Connecticut. The
day has gone down in New England history as a terrible foretaste of Judgment
Day.  For at noon the skies turned from blue to grey and by mid-afternoon had
blackened over so densely that, in that religious age, men fell on their knees and begged a final blessing before the end came.  The Connecticut House of Representatives was in session. And as some of the men fell down and others clamored for an immediate adjournment, the Speaker of the House, one Col. Davenport, came to his feet. He silenced them and said these words: "The day of judgment is either approaching or it is not. If it is not, there is no

therefore that candles may be brought."

The trustees of the Madrid Zoo read that there were only thirty-four

before the breed became extinct.  Never mind what Spanish wiles they had to
exercise to fulfill their ambition; suffice it to say that a whooping crane
was dispatched via air freight to the Madrid Zoo.

to buy it, and so he huffily walked out of the Miami Beach hotel when he

rates were only $70.  The following morning he went down to the hotel's
golf course and asked Scotty, the pro, to sell him a couple of golf balls.
"Sure," said Scotty.  "That'll be $15 apiece."

only charge $1 a ball!"

Then Nicholl, using his own calculations, demonstrated that it was
absolutely impossible to give any object at all the velocity of
12,000 yards per second.  And, algebra in hand, he maintained that
even if such a velocity could be attained, such a heavy projectile
could never be lifted beyond the limits of the Earth's atmosphere!
It would never reach even an altitude of twenty miles.  And
furthermore!  Even if such a speed could be attained, even if it
would suffice, the shell could not withstand the pressure of the
gases produced by igniting 1,600,000 pounds of powder.  And even if
it could resist the pressure, it could not withstand the
temperature, it would melt as it left the Columbiad, and a red-hot
rain would fall on the heads of the foolish spectators.

All my life though some have changed.
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain.
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still recall.
Some are dead and some are living,
In my life I've loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers,
There is no one compared with you,
All these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new.
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I'll love you more.

There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked the programmer: "Which is easier to
design: an accounting package or an operating system?"

"An operating system," replied the programmer.

The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief. "Surely an accounting
package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system," he
said.

"Not so," said the programmer, "when designing an accounting package,
the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different
ideas: how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it
must conform to the tax laws. By contrast, an operating system is not
limited by outside appearances. When designing an operating system,
the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas.
This is why an operating system is easier to design."

The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled. "That is all good and well, but
which is easier to debug?"

There's a trick to the Graceful Exit.  It begins with the vision to recognize
when a job, a life stage, a relationship is over--and to let go.  It means
leaving what's over without denying its validity or its past importance in our
lives.  It involves a sense of future, a belief that every exit line is an
entry, that we are moving on, rather than out.  The trick of retiring well may
be the trick of living well.  It's hard to recognize that life isn't a holding
action, but a process.  It's hard to learn that we don't leave the best parts
of ourselves behind, back in the dugout or the office.  We own what we learned
back there.  The experiences and the growth are grafted onto our lives.  And
when we exit, we can take ourselves along--quite gracefully.

oldest profession:

There once was a dog show to determine the world's smartest dog.  Three
dogs were in the finals. One dog belonged to a doctor.  One dog belonged
to an engineer.  And, one dog belonged to a lawyer.

For the finals each dog was given a bag of bones to see what it could
make.

The doctor said, "Stethoscope, go!"  The dog built a human skeleton.

The judges were ready to award the trophy right then.  But, they decided
to give the other dogs a try.

The engineer said, "Slide-rule, go!" (So, its an old joke.)  The dog
built a suspension bridge.

The judges were beside them selves.  Which dog would they pick?

The lawyer said. "Loop-hole, go!"  The dog ate the bones, got a
percentage of all the tolls from the bridge and screwed the other two
dogs.

Three bulls -- a big bull, a medium sized bull, and a small bull -- were
standing by a fence one day, chewing grass and looking out over the
fields.  The big one says, "See all of them cows out there?   Half of
'em are mine."  The medium sized one responds, "See all them cows?  A
third of them are MINE."   The little bull pipes up, "Hey, all the rest
of them cows are mine."

       After a while the bulls notice the farmer drive up with a
truck and unload another bull -- the hugest Brahma bull these other
bulls have ever seen.  The big bull stops chewing and says, with a wide-
eyed look, "He...he can have a third of my cows if he wants 'em."   The
medium sized bull trembles a bit when he says "He can have HALF of my
cows if he wants them."

       Then the two bigger bulls notice that the small bull is
snorting, bucking, pawing the ground, and putting on a ferocious act.
"What are you doing, fool!?" they say.  The small bull replies, "I
want to make sure he knows I'm a bull!"

Three doctors were talking about their favorite patients.  The first
said that he preferred operating on Germans because their organs were
lined up in exactly the right position.  The second preferred Japanese
because not only were their organs in exactly the right position, but
they were also color coded.  The third chimed in too.  "I'll take
lawyers any day.  Ever open one of those suckers up?  Only two working
parts - the mouth and the anus, and they are interchangeable."

Three great scientific theories of the structure of the universe are
the molecular, the corpuscular and the atomic.  A fourth affirms, with

more about the matter than the others.

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine      And then one day you find
Staying home to watch the rain      Ten years have got behind you
You are young and life is long      No one told you when to run
And there is time to kill today     You missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter       Hanging on in quiet desperation
Never seem to find the time         is the English way
Plans that either come to nought    The time is gone, the song is over
Or half a page of scribbled lines   Thought I'd something more to say...

Toni was a communist and very unhappy in capitalist Austria. He wanted
to go over the border to Russia, where everything was supposed to be
better. His friend Josef was interested too. However, they'd also
heard a few stories of repressions and shortages, so they didn't know
what to do.

"Look," said Toni, "I've got an idea. I'll go over first. If
everything's great, I'll write back a letter with blue ink. If things
really are awful, and everything's censored, I'll write back a letter
with green ink."

Toni went over the border. After several months Josef got the
following letter, written in blue ink:

"Dear Josef,

"Everything is just terrific. I'm doing very well. I've got a

We laugh at the Indian philosopher, who to account for the support
of the earth, contrived the hypothesis of a huge elephant, and to support
the elephant, a huge tortoise. If we will candidly confess the truth, we
know as little of the operation of the nerves, as he did of the manner in
which the earth is supported: and our hypothesis about animal spirits, or
about the tension and vibrations of the nerves, are as like to be true, as
his about the support of the earth.  His elephant was a hypothesis, and our
hypotheses are elephants.  Every theory in philosophy, which is built on
pure conjecture, is an elephant; and every theory that is supported partly
by fact, and partly by conjecture, is like Nebuchadnezzar's image, whose
feet were partly of iron, and partly of clay.

What Congress means by ethics is best explained by the tailor's story:

"Suppose I sell a suit to a young man for $200.  He tells me that
his family is footing the bill and that if I give him a receipt
for $400 to give to his parents, he will pay me $100 on the side.
The question of ethics is: Do I keep the extra $100 myself, or
do I tell my partner and split it with him?"

What does "BSS" mean?

Traditionally, executable Unix system programs are divided into text, data,
and BSS segments. The text segment contains executable code, the data
segment contains initialized variables, and the BSS segment contains
uninitialized variables. The letters BSS stand for Block Starting at Symbol.
@
What does "grep" mean?

The letters grep indicate "Globally search for a Regular Expression and
Print." In standard Unix system editors, the notation is g/re/p where re is
a regular expression. The simplest regular expression is a string of
characters where every character matches itself. More complicated regular
expressions can match any character, any one of a set of characters, or the
beginning or end of a line. Although Celtic influence on the Unix system
predominates over Hebraic, greptz means "belch" in Yiddish. Output from the
grep program looks remarkably similar.
@
What does "rc" stand for, and why are there so many
"rc" files?

The letters stand for Run-Com, the name of a command
file on early DEC operating systems. The Unix system's
original "rc" file was /etc/rc, which executes commands
when the system "boots" (or starts up). The name spread
to the C shell startup file .cshrc, the Mail startup
file .mailrc, the Berknet initialization file .netrc,
and the Netnews startup file .newsrc. Programmers could
have chosen a better suffix (such as init) but they
wanted to retain a realm of mystery in the system.

What is a robot you ask?  Well, the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy
holds the definition.

The Encyclopedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus
designed to do the work of a man.  The marketing division of Sirius
Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as 'Your Plastic Pal Who's Fun
To Be With'.  The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the
marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as 'a bunch of
mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution
comes', with a footnote to effect that the editors would welcome
applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics
correspondent.
       Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica that
had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years
in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics
Corporation as 'a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the

When I was seven years old, I was once reprimanded by my mother for an
act of collective brutality in which I had been involved at school.  A

together which not one of you would think of doing alone."  ...
Wherever one looks in the world of human organization, collective
responsibility brings a lowering of moral standards.  The military

together which nobody in his right mind would do alone.

Desiring this man's art and that man's state,
With what I most enjoy contented least.

Like to the lark at break of day arising,
From sullen Earth, sings hymns at Heaven's gate.

That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

bargained for.

Work was impossible.  The geeks had broken my spirit.  They had done too
many things wrong.  It was never like this for Mencken.  He lived like a

Working as Designed n.  Colloquialism used by software
maintenance people to indicate that while there is a
problem, it is not considered to affect the program
when the program is used for the purpose for which it
was designed. Of course, nobody uses programs the way

is usually some nasty remark about the 'designers'
mental condition when he designed it.

Writing of letters of recommendation has become hazardous; tell the truth
and you can be sued if the contents are negative.  A collection of "virtually
litigation-proof" phrases has been collated, called the Lexicon of
Intentionally Ambiguous Recommendations, or LIAR.
Here are some examples:
1) An inept person - "I enthusiastically recommend this
                  candidate with no qualifications
                  whatsoever."
2) Doesn't get along with others -
                  "I am pleased to say that this
                  candidate is a former colleague
                  of mine."
3) Unproductive -    "I can assure you that no person
                  would be better for the job."
4) Not worth considering -
                  "I would urge you to waste no time
                  making this candidate an offer of
                  employment."

Wrong Thing: n. A design, action, or decision that is clearly
   incorrect or inappropriate.  Often capitalized; always emphasized
   in speech as if capitalized.  The opposite of the {Right Thing};
   more generally, anything that is not the Right Thing.  In cases
   where `the good is the enemy of the best', the merely good ---
   although good --- is nevertheless the Wrong Thing. "In C, the
